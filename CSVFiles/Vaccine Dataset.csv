Vaccines,http://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/Vaccines/,"Vaccines, as with all products regulated by FDA, undergo a rigorous review of laboratory and clinical data to ensure the safety, efficacy, purity and potency of these products. Vaccines approved for marketing may also be required to undergo additional studies to further evaluate the vaccine and often to address specific questions about the vaccine's safety, effectiveness or possible side effects.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, vaccines have reduced preventable infectious diseases to an all-time low and now few people experience the devastating effects of measles, pertussis and other illnesses.The Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) regulates vaccine products. Many of these are childhood vaccines that have contributed to a significant reduction of vaccine-preventable diseases.",TRUE
Vaccine Safety: Are Vaccines Safe?,http://www.chop.edu/centers-programs/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-safety/are-vaccines-safe,"The first definition of the word safe is ""harmless."" This definition would imply that any negative consequence of a vaccine would make the vaccine unsafe. Using this definition, no vaccine is 100 percent safe. Almost all vaccines can cause pain, redness or tenderness at the site of injection. And some vaccines cause more severe side effects. For example, the pertussis (whooping cough) vaccine can cause persistent, inconsolable crying, high fever or seizures associated with fever. Although none of these severe symptoms result in permanent damage, they can be quite frightening to parents. But, in truth, few things meet the definition of ""harmless."" Even everyday activities contain hidden dangers. For example, every year in the United States, 350 people are killed in bath- or shower-related accidents, 200 people are killed when food lodges in their windpipe, and 100 people are struck and killed by lightning. However, few of us consider eating solid food, taking a bath, or walking outside on a rainy day as unsafe activities. We just figure that the benefits of the activity clearly outweigh the risks. The second definition of the word safe is ""having been preserved from a real danger."" Using this definition, the danger (the disease) must be significantly greater than the means of protecting against the danger (the vaccine). Or, said another way, a vaccine's benefits must clearly and definitively outweigh its risks. To better understand the definition of the word safe when applied to vaccines, let's examine four dierent vaccines and the diseases they prevent. Hear Dr. Offit explain the risks and benefits of vaccines by watching this short video, part of the Talking About Vaccines with Dr. Paul Offit video series. The hepatitis B vaccine has few side effects. However, one side effect is serious. About 1 of every 600,000 doses of hepatitis B vaccine is complicated by a severe allergic reaction called anaphylaxis. The symptoms of anaphylaxis are hives, difficulty breathing and a drop in blood pressure. Although no one has ever died because of the hepatitis B vaccine, the symptoms of anaphylaxis caused by the vaccine can be quite frightening. On the other hand, every year about 5,000 people die soon after being infected with hepatitis B virus. In addition, about 10,000 people every year suffer severe liver damage (called cirrhosis) or liver cancer caused by hepatitis B virus. People are much more likely to develop these severe and often fatal consequences of hepatitis B virus infection if they get infected when they are very young children. For this reason, the hepatitis B vaccine is recommended for newborns. Some parents wonder whether it is necessary to give the hepatitis B virus vaccine to newborns. They ask: ""How is a baby going to catch hepatitis B?"" But, befor the hepatitis B virus vaccine, every year in the United States about 18,000 children less than 10 years of age caught hepatitis B virus from someone other than their mother. Some children catch it from another family member, and some children catch it from someone outside the home who comes in contact with the baby. About 1 million people in the United States are infected with hepatitis B virus. However, because hepatitis B virus can cause a silent infection (meaning without obvious symptoms), many people who are infected with hepatitis B virus don't know that they have it. So it can be hard to tell from whom you could catch hepatitis B virus. Worse yet, many people don't realize that you can catch hepatitis B virus after coming into contact with minute quantities of blood through casual contact with someone who is infected (for example, sharing washcloths or toothbrushes). In fact, a milliliter of blood (about one-fifth of a teaspoon) from someone who is infected can contain as many as 1 billion infectious viruses, so people can be infected with quantities of infected blood small enough that they are not visible to the naked eye. Because the benefits of the hepatitis B vaccine clearly and definitively outweigh its risks, the hepatitis B vaccine is safe.",TRUE
Why Immunize Your Child,https://www.healthychildren.org/English/safety-prevention/immunizations/Pages/Why-Immunize-Your-Child.aspx?gclid=CLqG7qT_6tECFUUvgQodvXIJqA,"Immunizations have helped children stay healthy for more than 50 years. They are safe and they work. In fact, serious side effects are no more common than those from other types of medication such as antibiotics and fever reducers and pain relievers.Vaccinations have reduced the number of infections from vaccine-preventable diseases by more than 90%! Yet many parents still question their safety because of misinformation theyve received. Thats why its important to turn to a reliable and trusted source, including your child's doctor, for information.The following are answers to common questions parents have about immunizations.A:These diseases are less common in large part due to vaccines. If vaccines were not given, the bacteria and viruses that cause these diseases could begin to infect more and more children again.For example, before the Hib vaccine was developed in the 1980s, there were about 20,000 cases of Hib disease in the United States a year.Today there are fewer than 100 cases a year. However, the bacteria that causes Hib disease still exists. That is why childrenneed the vaccine to be protected.In the United States vaccines protect children from many diseases. However, in many parts of the world vaccine- preventable diseases are still common. Because diseases may be brought into the United States by Americans who travel abroad or from people visiting areas with current disease outbreaks, its important that your child is vaccinated.A: Yes. Vaccines work very well. Millions of children have been protected against serious illnesses because they were immunized. Most childhood vaccines are 90% to 99% effective in preventing disease. When a large majority of children have been vaccinated, it is expected that most who get the disease will have been vaccinated. And if a vaccinated child does get the disease, the symptoms are usually milder with less serious side effects or complications than in a child who hasnt been vaccinated.A: There may be mild side effects, like swelling, redness, and tenderness where the shot was given, but they do not last long. Your child may also have a slight fever and be fussy for a short time afterward. It is rare for side effects to be serious. However, call your child's doctor right away if your child hasYou should also call your child's doctor if you have any other concerns.A: Children with certain health problems may need to avoid some vaccines or get them later. In most cases, children with cancer, those taking oral or injected steroids for lung or kidney conditions, or those who have problems with their immune systems should not get vaccines that are made with live viruses. To protect these children it is very important for others to be vaccinated. For children with a recent history of nerve disorders, the pertussis part of the DTaP vaccine may need to be delayed. However, a child with a minor illness such as low-grade fever (<100.4F), an ear infection, cough, a runny nose, or mild diarrhea can safely be immunized.",TRUE
Benefits and risks of vaccination,http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/vaccinations/Pages/benefits-and-risks.aspx,"All medicines have side effects. However, vaccines are among the safest and the benefits of vaccinations far outweigh the risk of side effects.Whenyou're considering a vaccination for yourself or your child,it's natural tofocuson the potential side effects. But a better approach is to try to balance the benefits of having a vaccine against the chances of harm.Most side effects from vaccination are mild and short-lived.It's quitecommon to have redness or swelling around the injection site, but this soon goes away.Younger children or babies may bea bit irritable or unwell, or have a slight temperature. Again, this usually goes away withinone or two days.Read thisNHSleaflet about the common side effects of vaccinations in babies and children up to five years of age (PDF, 118kb).In much rarer cases,some people have an allergic reaction soon after a vaccination. Thisis usuallya rash or itching that affects part or all ofthe body. The GPsand nurseswho givethe vaccine are trainedin how to treat this.On very rare occasions,a severe allergic reaction may happen within a few minutes of the vaccination. This iscalled an anaphylactic reaction. It can lead to breathing difficulties and, in some cases, collapse.Remember that anaphylactic reactions are extremely rare (less than one in a million). Vaccination staff are trained to deal with this, andthese reactions arecompletely reversible if treated promptly.Find out how to report a side effect of a vaccination.Vaccination is different from giving medicine to an unwell child to make them better. The benefits of vaccination are invisible. The idea is that your child won't become ill with measles or end up in intensive care with meningitis.It may be tempting to say ""no"" to vaccination and ""leave it to nature"". However,deciding not to vaccinate your child puts them at risk of catching a range of potentially serious, even fatal, diseases.In reality, having a vaccination is much safer than not having one. They're not 100% effective in every child, but they're the best defence against the epidemics that used tokill or permanently disablemillions of children and adults.Read more about the safety of vaccinations.",TRUE
THIMEROSAL IN VACCINES,http://www.vaccinesafety.edu/cc-thim.htm,"A study of blood levels of mercury following receipt of thimerosal-containing vaccines in premature infants found that the blood half-life of intramuscular ethyl mercury is shorter than that of oral methyl mercury in adults.

[free link to full text] (09-27-07) CDC has also posted a transcript of a Sep 26 2007 press briefing including Q&A following the briefing [link]. More than 1000 children with different thimerosal exposures from the prenatal period until 7 months of age were evaluated using a battery of 42 neurodevelopmental tests at 7-10 years of age. The analyses involved 378 comparisons of outcomes including possible differences of effects on boys vs. girls. Ninety-five percent of the analyses showed no differences in outcomes by thimerosal exposure. Five percent of the comparisons revealed differences in outcomes by thimerosal exposure. Using a cutoff of 5% for statistical significance, these findings would be expected by chance. More findings of slight improvement in scores with increasing thimerosal exposure were found than findings of decreased performance with increasing exposure. The effects in both directions on test performance were quite small. These findings have been interpreted as probable chance occurrences by the authors. The study did find an increased rate of tic disorders associated with thimerosal. This finding had been observed in two prior studies and will be investigated further. This study will undoubtedly undergo intense evaluation by many groups. CDC will be making the dataset available publicly so that other groups can conduct additional analyses.A Canadian study reconfirms older findings ruling out an association between pervasive developmental disorder [PDD] (including autism) and high levels of ethylmercury exposures or MMR vaccines. The specific findings by Fombonne et al in Pediatrics include: Autism and Thimerosal - thimerosal exposure was unrelated to the increasing trend in PDD prevalence. Autism and MMR - no association between MMR vaccinations (both 1 and 2 doses) and autism or PDD rates. The study found the highest rates of PDD in children with no thimerosal exposure (from vaccines). The study also noted a slight decrease in the rates of MMR vaccine at the same time as rates of PDD were increasing. Fombonne E et al.

Systematic Review of Vaccine Safety May Allay Parents' Concerns,https://www.aap.org/en-us/about-the-aap/aap-press-room/pages/Systematic-Review-of-Vaccine-Safety-May-Allay-.aspx,"A systematic review of research on vaccine safety, published online July 1 in Pediatrics, updates a 2011 Institute of Medicine (IOM) report on the safety of vaccines recommended for children aged six years and younger. The study, ""Safety of Vaccines Used for Routine Immunization of U.S. Children: A Systematic Review,"" to be published in the August 2014 Pediatrics, is part of a larger report on the safety of vaccines for adults, adolescents and children requested by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. Researchers from the RAND Corporation conducted a systematic review of the evidence published since the IOM report on vaccines for children under age 6, including DTaP (diphtheria, tetanus and acellular pertussis), hepatitis A, hepatitis B, influenza, meningococcal, MMR (measles, mumps and rubella), and varicella vaccines. The report also reviews the evidence on several childhood vaccines that were not studied in the 2011 IOM report, including Haemophilus influenza type b (Hib), pneumococcal, rotavirus, and inactivated poliovirus vaccines. The evidence is strong that MMR vaccine is not associated with autism, which is consistent with previous reviews on the topic. Researchers also identified strong evidence that MMR, DTaP, Td (tetanus), Hib and hepatitis B vaccines are not associated with childhood leukemia. Studies did show an association of several serious adverse events with vaccines, but these events were very rare, such as intussusception after rotavirus vaccine. Researchers conclude the findings may allay concerns of some parents about vaccine safety.",TRUE
Vaccine Safety,http://www.vaccineinformation.org/vaccine-safety/,"The United States' long-standing vaccine safety system ensures that vaccines are as safe as possible. In fact, currently, the United States has the safest, most effective vaccine supply in its history. . The agency ensures the safety, effectiveness, and availability of vaccines for the United States. Before a vaccine is approved by the FDA for use by the public, results of studies on safety and effectiveness of the vaccine are evaluated by highly trained FDA scientists and doctors. FDA also inspects the sites where vaccines are made to make sure they follow strict manufacturing guidelines. Although most common side effects of a vaccine are identified in studies before the vaccine is licensed, rare adverse events may not be detected in these studies. Therefore, the U.S. vaccine safety system continuously monitors for possible side effects after a vaccine is licensed. When millions of people receive a vaccine, less common side effects that were not identified earlier may be detected. If a link is found between a possible side effect and a vaccine, public health officials take appropriate action. First, additional studies will be quickly conducted to determine if there is an association between the vaccine and the side effect. If additional studies indicate a true association between the vaccine and the side effect, then public health experts will weigh the benefits of the vaccine against its risks to determine if recommendations for using the vaccine should change. Monitoring Vaccine Safety - Why is it important to monitor vaccine safety? Vaccines are held to the highest standard of safety. The United States currently has the safest, most effective vaccine supply in history. Years of testing are required before a vaccine can be licensed. Once in use, vaccines are continually monitored for safety and efficacy. Vaccines, like any medication, can cause adverse events. However, a decision not to immunize a child also involves risk. It is a decision to put the child and others who come into contact with him or her at risk of contracting a disease that could be dangerous or deadly. Like any medication, vaccines, can cause side effects. The most common side effects are mild. On the other hand, many vaccine-preventable disease symptoms can be serious, or even deadly. Even though many of these diseases are rare in this country, they still occur around the world and can be brought into the United States, putting unvaccinated children at risk. The side effects associated with getting vaccines are almost always mild (such as redness and swelling where the shot was given) and go away within a few days. If your child experiences a reaction at the injection site, you can use a cool, wet cloth to reduce redness, soreness, and swelling. Serious side effects following vaccination, such as severe allergic reaction, are very rare and doctors and clinic staff are trained to deal with them. Pay extra attention to your child for a few days after vaccination. If you see something that concerns you, call your childs doctor.

Vaccines: The real issues in vaccine safety,http://www.nature.com/news/2011/110525/full/473436a.html,"Hysteria about false vaccine risks often overshadows the challenges of detecting the real ones.John Salamone is not a vaccine sceptic. He has never been persuaded by spurious claims that vaccines are toxic to children and responsible for autism or a host of other ailments. But tragically, Salamone found out first-hand that vaccines do have real, rare side effects when he saw his infant son, David, become weak and unable to crawl shortly after receiving the oral polio vaccine in 1990. After about two years of physical therapy and doctors' visits, Salamone learned that owing to a weakened immune system, David had contracted polio from the vaccine. ""We basically gave him polio that day,"" says Salamone, who has retired from a position as a non-profit executive, and lives in Mount Holly, Virginia.That was a known risk of the vaccination, which causes roughly one case of the disease per 2.4 million doses, often in people with an immune deficiency. A safer, inactivated, polio vaccine was available at the time, but the oral vaccine was cheaper, easier to administer and thought to be more effective at controlling outbreaks. But by the 1980s, polio had been all but eliminated in the United States; all cases originating in the country came from the vaccine. Salamone and other parents successfully campaigned for the United States to shift to the safer version in the late 1990s.Vaccines face a tougher safety standard than most pharmaceutical products because they are given to healthy people, often children. What they stave off is unseen, and many of the diseases are now rare, with their effects forgotten. So only the risks of vaccines, low as they may be, loom in the public imagination. A backlash against vaccination, spurred by the likes of Andrew Wakefield a UK surgeon who was struck off the medical register after making unfounded claims about the safety of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine and a litany of celebrities and activists, has sometimes overshadowed scientific work to uncover real vaccine side effects. Many false links have been dispelled, including theories that the MMR vaccine and the vaccine preservative thimerosal cause autism1. But vaccines do carry risks, ranging from rashes or tenderness at the site of injection to fever-associated seizures called febrile convulsions and dangerous infections in those with compromised immune systems.Serious problems are rare, so it is hard to prove that a vaccine causes them. Studies to confirm or debunk vaccine-associated risks can take a long time and, in the meantime, public-health officials must make difficult decisions on what to do and how to communicate with the public. Still, such work is necessary to maintain public trust, says Neal Halsey, a paediatrician at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore, Maryland. ""If we don't do the research, there will be more people who don't believe in vaccines,"" he says.Technological advances have made modern vaccines purer and safer than their historical counterparts. Most developed countries have switched to the inactivated polio vaccine and stopped using whole-cell pertussis (whooping cough) vaccines, which are made from killed bacteria and cause relatively high rates of arm swelling, febrile convulsions and periods of limpness or unresponsiveness.Improved safety means that researchers are sometimes searching for vanishingly small risks. Although vaccines must undergo stringent safety tests before distribution, the trials typically don't enrol enough people to catch risks on the order of one case per 10,000100,000 people (see 'Calculating risks'). The only way to find such side effects is to deploy the vaccine in the population and watch.Officials have become increasingly vigilant. As worries about pandemic H1N1 influenza spread in 200910, several companies worked to prepare as many vaccine doses as possible. Meanwhile, health officials launched an unprecedented surveillance effort to monitor the vaccines' safety. US scientists and officials studied data from voluntary adverse-event reports, managed-care organizations, health-insurance companies, immunization registries, a network of neurologists and various health-care systems. European scientists linked data from 15 countries. And Chinese officials instructed health-care workers to report potential side effects within 24 hours; for the most serious events, they had two hours.Scientists were specifically looking for Guillain-Barr syndrome, a paralytic disorder that is often treatable but can cause long-term disability or death. A 1976 swine-flu vaccine distributed in the United States was associated with between five and nine cases per one million vaccine recipients. Studies of subsequent flu vaccines have not shown a consistent link, but officials have been on the lookout for it. During the 200910 pandemic, something stranger turned up: some 60 cases of narcolepsy emerged among 4- to 19-year-olds in Finland. Most had received the H1N1 vaccine Pandemrix, made by GlaxoSmithKline in Brentford, UK. Another narcolepsy cluster showed up in Sweden. Scientists have yet to confirm whether the vaccine caused the rise in incidence.Surveillance efforts have paid off for a variety of vaccines. A rotavirus vaccine was suspended in the United States in 1999 after public-health officials received 15 reports of intussusception, an infolding of the bowel, in vaccinated infants. The mechanism is uncertain, but the live-virus vaccine might cause swelling of bowel lymph nodes and increase contraction, leading to infolding. The vaccine is estimated to have caused about one case of intussusception per 10,000 recipients.In 2007, Nicola Klein, co-director of the Kaiser Permanente Vaccine Study Center in Oakland, California, and her colleagues found that children aged between 12 and 23 months who had been immunized with a combination vaccine for measles, mumps, rubella and varicella (MMRV) had more febrile convulsions 710 days after vaccination than those receiving separate MMR and varicella vaccines. The finding prompted a US immunization advisory committee to withdraw its preference for the MMRV vaccine. A subsequent study2 suggested that the combined vaccine resulted in one more febrile convulsion per 2,300 doses than the MMR and varicella vaccines given separately.Efforts are under way to improve surveillance in low- and middle-income countries, some of which are gaining increased access to vaccines through an international programme called the GAVI Alliance (formerly the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation), based in Geneva, Switzerland. These areas could soon see new vaccines for diseases such as dengue and cholera. In 2006, the Pan American Health Organization, based in Washington DC, started a surveillance network among five Latin American countries. The World Health Organization (WHO) in Geneva is working with 12 countries, including Iran, Tunisia, Vietnam and India, to develop methods and tools for vaccine-safety monitoring, and half are already reporting to a global database, says Patrick Zuber, the WHO's group leader of global vaccine safety.Researchers have also started conducting larger clinical trials. Pre-licensure trials for two new rotavirus vaccines, RotaTeq by Merck, based in Whitehouse Station, New Jersey, and Rotarix by GlaxoSmithKline, each enrolled more than 60,000 infants to evaluate safety3,4. But even these large trials cannot rule out rare events, so efforts would be better spent on well planned surveillance after licensing, argues Rino Rappuoli, global head of vaccines research at Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics in Siena, Italy. With big pre-licensure trials, ""you may feel better as a regulator, but you're not answering the scientific question"", he says. Preliminary post-licensure studies in Mexico have detected a possible slight increase in intussusception risk after the first dose of Rotarix, and a similar pattern has emerged in Australia for both vaccines5. However, some researchers speculate that rotavirus vaccination may also protect against intussusception later.Even if a possible side effect is found, long periods of uncertainty can follow. To amass convincing evidence, scientists sometimes need to do controlled studies in multiple countries, covering hundreds of thousands or even millions of people. Scientists have not yet conclusively determined whether Pandemrix contributed to the European cluster of narcolepsy cases.Scientists in the Vaccine Adverse Event Surveillance & Communication Consortium, a European research network, are examining narcolepsy diagnosis rates and comparing cases with matched controls across several European Union countries, some of which used different H1N1 vaccines. Data suggest that diagnosis rates rose slightly in several countries starting in 2008, before H1N1 vaccines were being distributed, but not enough to explain the episode in Finland, says principal investigator Miriam Sturkenboom, a pharmacoepidemiologist at Erasmus University Medical Center Rotterdam in the Netherlands. GlaxoSmithKline is also funding a study in Canada, where an H1N1 vaccine nearly identical to Pandemrix was used, but no rise in narcolepsy has been reported.The increase in narcolepsy diagnoses might be explained by heightened disease awareness or infections with the H1N1 virus itself, says Jan Bonhoeffer, a paediatric-infectious-disease specialist at the University Children's Hospital Basel in Switzerland, and chief executive of the Brighton Collaboration, an international vaccine-safety research network. He says that the narcolepsy story fits a familiar pattern, similar to that seen with MMR and autism: people are eager to find an underlying cause for a serious, chronic, poorly understood disease.Researchers need to investigate possible safety issues quickly, Bonhoeffer adds. Otherwise, by the time scientists conclude that a concern is unfounded, ""no one cares, and it takes years to build up the trust again"", he says. ""So often, the widely communicated concern has caused more harm than it intended to prevent."" A global vaccine-safety network would give scientists a faster way to test hypotheses with sufficient sample sizes, he says. In that spirit, the WHO is coordinating a global study on pandemic H1N1 flu vaccines and Guillain-Barr syndrome.But strictly controlled randomized trials the highest standard of evidence for determining causality are often not possible because of the large number of participants needed. And randomized trials in one location will not prevent some researchers questioning whether the results apply in others, says Alfred Berg, a clinical epidemiologist at the University of Washington in Seattle.Even if surveillance efforts became faster and more thorough, public-health officials still need to make quick decisions with incomplete data. Authorities often err on the side of caution, but warnings can make the public wary. In March, for example, Japanese officials suspended a vaccine for pneumococcal illnesses and one for Haemophilus influenzae type b when four children died shortly after immunization. Officials later concluded that there was no direct evidence of a link, but the episode still caused a scare, says Pier Luigi Lopalco, head of the vaccine-preventable-diseases programme at the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control in Solna, Sweden. Suspending a vaccine tends to get more media attention than resuming one, he says, so people remember only the threat.US government officials have drawn criticism for pushing for removal of thimerosal from vaccines, despite a lack of evidence that it poses a risk. ""People said, why are you removing this if it's not a problem?"" says Ken Bromberg, a paediatrician at the Brooklyn Hospital Center in New York. ""It must really be a problem even though you say it's not."" But inaction would have caused a loss of credibility, says Halsey. ""That is not something I think the public would have accepted.""Researchers have long known that some individuals are more susceptible to vaccine risks than others. Immunocompromised individuals have generally been discouraged from receiving live-virus vaccines. But other possible vulnerabilities are less clear. Some speculate that children with metabolic disorders might be prone to vaccine side effects, but two studies published in April suggest otherwise. Klein and her colleagues reported6 that children with inherited metabolic disorders do not show an increase in emergency-department visits or hospitalizations in the 30 days after being immunized. The other study found that children with one type of metabolic disorder urea cycle disorders did not have more serious metabolic problems than usual within 21 days of vaccination7.Some researchers hope that doctors will eventually be able to screen people for genetic predispositions to vaccine side effects. Gregory Poland, a vaccinologist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, says that once predispositions have been identified, genetic screening would at least make the risks and benefits explicit. Scientists have begun studying predispositions to side effects from smallpox vaccination: Kathryn Edwards, a vaccinologist at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, and her colleagues have reported8 two genes that might be associated with reactions such as rashes, and Poland's team is searching for genetic risk factors for myopericarditis inflammation of the heart muscle and surrounding tissue.Even if immunization does prove risky for certain children, withholding the vaccine could pose a greater threat. Vaccine-preventable diseases can be particularly severe or even fatal for patients with metabolic disorders, says Marshall Summar, chief of the division of genetics and metabolism at the Children's National Medical Center in Washington DC.Edwards and her colleagues have been studying how children with mitochondrial disorders, a group of metabolic disorders, respond to vaccines and natural infections. If vaccines present a risk, doctors could take steps to counteract possible effects, for example by ensuring that the child is well nourished after immunization, says Edwards.Safer vaccines and manufacturing processes are also in the works. A Novartis plant in Holly Springs, North Carolina, will produce influenza vaccine doses in cell culture, rather than the industry-standard chicken eggs. This process will improve reliability and reduce allergic reactions to egg proteins, says Rappuoli. The plant will be ready to make pandemic-flu vaccine this year if needed, he says.Researchers are also developing replacements for vaccines that can be risky for vulnerable groups. These include current smallpox vaccines that cannot safely be given to immunocompromised people; the tuberculosis vaccine, which is not recommended for HIV-positive infants; and the yellow-fever vaccine, which puts elderly people at particular risk of a yellow-fever-like illness. The challenge will be to make safer vaccines just as effective: James Cherry, a paediatric-infectious-disease specialist at the University of California, Los Angeles, speculates that an outbreak of whooping cough in California in 2010 might have occurred partly because the safer acellular pertussis vaccines now in common use in developed countries tend to be less effective than the best whole-cell vaccines.Researchers are quick to emphasize that the benefits of vaccines still greatly outweigh the risks. But as diseases recede from the public's memory, the population's tolerance for side effects will drop even further. ""If you don't know the diseases and you haven't seen them, then you really aren't willing to accept any risk,"" says Edwards. Despite scientists' best efforts, eliminating risk is impossible. Vaccines are biological products with biological effects, says Juhani Eskola, deputy director general of Finland's National Institute for Health and Welfare in Helsinki.

Kennedy Jr., a proponent of a widely discredited theory that vaccines cause autism, said Tuesday that President-elect Donald Trump asked him to chair a new commission on vaccines.Hours later, however, a spokeswoman for Trumps transition said that while Trump would like to create a commission on autism, no final decision had been made.If Trump follows through, the stunning move would push up against established science, medicine and the governments position on the issue. It comes after Trump who has long been critical of vaccines met at Trump Tower with Kennedy, who has spearheaded efforts to roll back child vaccination laws.The President-elect enjoyed his discussion with Robert Kennedy Jr. on a range of issues and appreciates his thoughts and ideas, Trump transition spokeswoman Hope Hicks said in a statement. The President-elect is exploring the possibility of forming a commission on autism, which affects so many families; however no decisions have been made at this time.The President-elect looks forward to continuing the discussion about all aspects of autism with many groups and individuals, she added.[The facts about vaccines, autism and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.s conspiracy theory]Speaking to reporters earlier Tuesday in the lobby of Trump Tower in New York, Kennedy said that Trump called him to request the meeting and that he accepted the offer of a position on the commission during the meeting.President-elect Trump has some doubts about the current vaccine policies, and he has questions about it, Kennedy said. His opinion doesnt matter, but the science does matter, and we ought to be reading the science, and we ought to be debating the science.And that everybody ought to be able to be assured that the vaccines that we have hes very pro-vaccine, as am I but theyre as safe as they possibly can be, he added.There is a federal advisory committee on immunization, made up of medical and public health experts who develop recommendations on how vaccines are used in the United States.The announcement was met with alarm from health professionals who say that putting a proponent of a conspiracy theory in a position of authority on the issue is dangerous.[The origins of Donald Trumps autism/vaccine theory and how it was completely debunked eons ago]Thats very frightening; its difficult to imagine anyone less qualified to serve on a commission for vaccine science, said Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine and president of the Sabin Vaccine Institute, a nonprofit that works to control, treat and eliminate vaccine-preventable and neglected tropical diseases.The science is clear: Massive evidence showing no link between vaccines and autism, and as both a scientist who develops vaccines for poverty-related neglected diseases and the father of an adult daughter with autism, theres not even any plausibility for a link, Hotez continued. Autism is a genetic condition.Our nations public health will suffer if this nascent neo-antivaxxer movement is not stopped immediately, he added.Kennedy has been a proponent of nonmedical exemptions for parents who seek to prevent their children from being vaccinated, which is mandatory in most states.He has argued that mercury-based additives in vaccines explain the link to autism. And he has alleged that government scientists, journalists and pharmaceutical companies have colluded to hide the truth from the public.They get the shot. That night they have a fever of 103. They go to sleep, and three months later their brain is gone, Kennedy said at the premiere of an anti-vaccination film screening in California in 2015. This is a holocaust, what this is doing to our country.[A horrifying reminder of what life without vaccines was really like]Kennedy is known to be an occasional conspiracy theorist and longtime opponent of mandatory vaccination laws. In 2006, he wrote in Rolling Stone magazine that the Republican Party had stolen the 2004 election from Democratic candidate John F. Kerry. At a 2013 speech in Dallas, he said he doesnt believe the lone gunman theory of the assassination of his uncle, President John F. Kennedy.Trump notably expressed support for the theory that vaccinations are linked to autism at a Republican presidential debate in 2015.[The GOPs dangerous debate on vaccines and autism]We had so many instances, people that work for me, just the other day, 2 years old, a beautiful child, went to have the vaccine and came back and a week later got a tremendous fever, got very, very sick, now is autistic, Trump said.The comments were widely denounced by medical professionals who say that there is no evidence that vaccines lead to autism. In fact, the study that popularized the idea has been retracted and discredited as fraudulent. Multiple high-quality studies have found no link between vaccines and autism.Trumps claim was rejected on the same debate stage by retired neurosurgeon Benjamin Carson, whom Trump has now nominated to serve as his secretary of housing and urban development.The fact of the matter is we have extremely well-documented proof that theres no autism associated with vaccinations, Carson said.The controversy began in 1998 after The Lancet, a respected medical journal, published a paper by researcher Andrew Wakefield and colleagues linking the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine to autism. It had a sample of only 12 subjects and speculative conclusions but launched a global movement joined by celebrities including Jenny McCarthy and Jim Carrey, who warned parents to stop vaccinating their children. A drop in MMR vaccinations followed.But the study was a fraud. The Lancet determined that Wakefield had been funded by attorneys for parents who had brought lawsuits against vaccine companies. In 2010, the journal retracted the paper. Wakefield was stripped of his medical license. Large studies that examined whether there is an association between vaccines and autism, including one that examined 96,000 U.S. children, found none.[Robert Kennedy Jr.s belief in autism-vaccine connection, and its political peril]The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said flatly that there is no link between vaccines and autism and that vaccine ingredients do not cause autism. Scores of studies from around the world since then have shown conclusively that vaccines do not cause autism. Every relevant scientific and medical organization has examined the evidence and concluded that vaccines are safe and effective and that the real danger lies in skipping or delaying them.Still, the theory has retained its adherents. The United States has experienced recent measles outbreaks linked to unvaccinated residents, including one in 2014 that infected 383 people, most of them in Amish communities in Ohio. In 2015, another multistate outbreak was linked to Californias Disneyland theme park. In both years, the source of the infection was believed to be people who brought the virus home after visiting the Philippines.In tweets as early as 2012, Trump expressed skepticism about vaccines, and in 2014 he said that doctors lied about vaccines. In other tweets, Trump has referred to vaccines as the cause of doctor-inflicted autism.Massive combined inoculations to small children is the cause for big increase in autism, Trump said in an August 2012 tweet.At the presidential debate in 2015, he claimed that his children had been vaccinated in small doses.I am totally in favor of vaccines, but I want smaller doses over a longer period of time, Trump said. Because you take a baby in, and Ive seen it. Ive had my children taken care of over a long period of time, over a two- or three-year period of time.Trumps statements at the Republican debate in 2015 were denounced as false by the American Academy of Pediatrics, which released a strongly worded condemnation.[The challenges to public health under a Trump administration]Claims that vaccines are linked to autism, or are unsafe when administered according to the recommended schedule, have been disproved by a robust body of medical literature, said Karen Remley, executive director of the AAP. It is dangerous to public health to suggest otherwise.There is no alternative immunization schedule. Delaying vaccines only leaves a child at risk of disease for a longer period of time; it does not make vaccinating safer. Vaccines work, plain and simple, she added.Autism is now considered a spectrum of brain disorders with a multitude of causes. According to Autism Speaks, people with the disorder can have trouble with social interaction, verbal and nonverbal communication and repetitive behaviors. One in 68 U.S. children are considered to be on the autism spectrum a tenfold increase from 40 years earlier, largely due to changes in how autism is defined and diagnosed.Trump names Scott Pruitt, Oklahoma attorney general suing EPA on climate change, to head the EPA7 things about vaccines and autism that the movie Vaxxed wont tell youThe ultimate guide to health care under a Trump presidency",TRUE
Top 6 Reasons Why Parents are Choosing Not to Vaccinate their Kids,http://www.collective-evolution.com/2015/02/15/the-top-6-reasons-why-parents-are-choosing-not-to-vaccinate-their-kids/,"More and more parents around the globe are choosing to opt out of vaccinating themselves and their children. As a result of this trend thats been gaining more and more momentum, a harsh response has come from the pro-vaccine community -criticizing parents for their decision to not vaccinate. At the end of the day its not really about pro-vaccination or anti-vaccination, its not one against the other or about pointing fingers and judgement, its simply about looking at all of the information from a neutral standpoint. Its about asking questions and communicating so people can make the best possible decisions for themselves and their children. Parents love their kids and the vaccine controversy has made it difficult for many parents to know what to do.Its not just parents, its doctors too.A new study published in the journalEbioMedicineoutlines this point, stating in the introduction:Over the past two decades several vaccine controversies have emerged in various countries, including France, inducing worries about severe adverse effects and eroding confidence in health authorities, experts, and science (Larson et al., 2011). These two dimensions are at the core of the vaccine hesitancy (VH) observed in the general population. VH is defined as delay in acceptance of vaccination, or refusal, or even acceptance with doubts about its safety and benefits, with all these behaviors and attitudes varying according to context, vaccine, and personal profile, despite the availability of vaccine services (Group, 2014,Larson et al., 2014, Dub et al., 2013). VH presents a challenge to physicians who must address their patients concerns about vaccines and ensure satisfactory vaccination coverage.The study concludes with the observation that after repeated vaccine controversies in France, some vaccine hesitancy exists among French GPs, whose recommendation behaviours depend on their trust in authorities, their perception of the utility and risks of vaccines, and their comfort in explaining them.As a result, the study outlines how up to 43 % of GPs sometimes. or never, recommend at least one specific vaccine to their patients.The percentages differ because the study was broken down as to which vaccines, and whether they are recommended never, sometimes, often or always. You can refer to the study for more details.The authors overall findingssuggest that VH [vaccine hesitancy] is prevalent among French GPs. It may make them ill at ease in addressing their patients concerns about vaccination, which in turn might reinforce patients VH.Again, this isnt a secret, another study (out of many, cited in the France publication) outlines how more research is needed to understand why some health professionals, trained in medical sciences, still have doubts regarding the safety and effectiveness of vaccination. (source)Parents who are choosing not to vaccinate their children are not just doing it based on belief, they are doing it based on science and information, some of which will be presented in this article. This science and information is nowhere near emphasized to the point where the science and information on the other side of the coin is (pro vaccine). Parents who choose not to vaccinate themselves or their children are clearly intelligent, and they should not be made to look like fools. On the other hand, parents who are choosing to vaccinate their children are also intelligent. Those who choose to vaccinate should not be made out to be the ones who have made the right decision when there is evidence on both sides of the coin thatclearlyshows parents who are not vaccinating their children could also be making the right decision.Id also like to state that there are multiple vaccines, some may be safe, some may not be. There are also criticisms of all the studies mentioned, as well as bias. That being said, all of the studies in this article, with the exception of one or two, have been published in credible peer-reviewed scientific journals. That should not take away from the important work of many independent scientists from all over the world.This article will present a few of the many reasons as to why parents are choosing to not vaccine their children. I am choosing to do this article and not one on why parents are choosing to vaccinate their children because its already very well known as to why they choose to vaccinate their children. I am also doing it to show you why parents who do not vaccinate are not crazy at all, and in fact quite intelligent and up to date on important information.Bringing up the idea that vaccines, in some way, are linked at all to autism can be greeted with a harsh reaction. Some people wont even entertain the idea, or look at information that suggests there could be a link. Truth is, there are plenty of studies that stress the idea that there could be a link, and that there is a link. At the same time, there are plenty of studies that stress there is no link, and that vaccines are not in any way linked to autism. I am referring to peer reviewed publications all the way to important independent research thats not sponsored by the vaccine manufacturers themselves.STUDIES SHOWING VACCINES ARE NOT LINKED TO AUTISMStarting off with some of the most recent data available, a study published in the JournalVaccinedetermined that:The study concluded that vaccinations are not associated with the development of autism or autism spectrum disorder. It was a meta-analysis done by researchers at the University of Sydney, in Australia. It examined ten studies involving more than one million children affirming that vaccines dont cause autism. (1)In March of 2013, the Journal ofPaediatricspublished a study titled Increasing exposure to Antibody-Stimulating Proteins and Polysaccharides (antigens) in Vaccines is Not Associated with Risk of Autism. The study found that vaccines, during the first couple of years of life are not related to the risk of developing an ASD diagnosis. They analyzed data from a case-control study conducted in 3 managed care organizations (MCOs) of 256 children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and 752 control children matched on birth year, sex and MCO. (2)Another study published in theJournal of Paediatricstitled Thimerosal exposure in infants and developmental disorders: a retrospective cohort study in the United Kingdom does not support a causal association concluded that, with the possible exception of tics, there was no evidence that thimerosal exposure via the DTP/DT vaccines causes any neurodevelopment disorders. (3)A report published in theCanadian Journal of Neurological Sciencesemphasized how there is an overwhelming majority showing no causal association between the Measles-Mumps-Rubella (MMR) and autism. It also determined that there was no convincing evidence that thimerosal has any role in autism.(4)A study published straight from the CDC and National Immunization program determined that the evidence is now convincing that the measles-mumps-rubella vaccines do not cause autism or any type of autism spectrum disorder. (5)The list literally goes on and on here, study after study in peer-reviewed scientific journals claim no link between vaccines/vaccine ingredients and autism.This is why many people reject the notion that vaccines could (in any way) be linked to autism. But that rejection is usually out of ignorance, and those guilty are parents, people like me and you, medical professionals and more. Its our tendency to believe what we are told (usually through mass marketing alone) without ever doing the research for ourselves.As I did in the previous section, I will try to start of with a couple of more recent studies. If vaccines arent linked to autism, why are scientists/researchers emphasizing that they could be, and showing that there is a possible link? (Keep in mind the Bradford -Hill Criteria, which is explained in some of the studies) These studies are contradictory to the ones above, yet conducted by people of the same qualifications and published in peer-reviewed scientific journals. Lets take a look.A study published in theJournal of Toxicologyby scientists from the University of British Colombia, Louisiana, and MIT outlines how Aluminum up until the 1820s -when the industrial extraction of AI made it possible to bring it into our food, manufacturing, medicines, and more -it was almost completely absent from the biosphere. The paper outlines how aluminum is harmful to the Central Nervous System (CNS), acting in a number of deleterious ways and across multiple levels to induce biosemiotic entropy. (6)Biosemiotic entropy is basically the corruption of biological messages from genetics, epigenetics, proteins, cells, tissues and organs. The paper points out how CNS problems are correlated with diseases like autism spectrum disorder, and makes a strong argument that Aluminum adjuvants in the form of pediatric vaccines could be contributing to increased rates of autism spectrum disorders. (page 8).One of the authors of this paper, Dr. Chris Shaw, a neurologist at the University of British Columbia explains the danger of aluminum in vaccines. When aluminum comes from a vaccine, it stays in the body, and studies have shown that the adjuvants do not stay localized but rather travel to the brain where they can be detected up to a year after the injection.A study published in the JournalCurrent Medical Chemistryin 2011 stated that:Aluminum is an experimentally demonstrated neurotoxin and the most commonly used vaccine adjuvant. Despite almost 90 years of widespread use of aluminum adjuvants, medical sciences understanding about their mechanisms of action is still remarkably poor. There is also a concerning scarcity of data on toxicology and pharmacokinetics of these compounds. In spite of this, the notion that aluminum in vaccines is safe appears to be widely accepted. Experimental research, however, clearly shows that aluminum adjuvants have a potential to induce serious immunological disorders in humans. In particular, aluminum in adjuvant form carries a risk for autoimmunity, long-term brain inflammation and associated neurological complications and may thus have profound and widespread adverse health consequences. (7)The paper points out how aluminum could be a culprit in the development of a wide body of neurodegenerative disease, one of them being autism.Here is a statement I took from the paper, for the specific citations you can look at the actual paper.The issue of vaccine safety thus becomes even more pertinent given that, to the best of our knowledge, no adequate clinical studies have been conducted to establish the safety of concomitant administration of two experimentally-established neurotoxins, aluminum and mercury, the latter in the form of ethyl mercury (thimerosal) in infants and children. Since these molecules negatively affect many of the same biochemical processes and enzymes implicated in the etiology of autism, the potential for a synergistic toxic action is plausible [31, 47]. Additionally, for the purpose of evaluating safety and efficacy, vaccine clinical trials often use an aluminium-containing placebo, either containing the same or greater amount of aluminum as the test vaccine [48-51]. Without exception, these trials report a comparable rate of adverse reactions between the placebo and the vaccine group (for example, 63.7% vs 65.3% of systemic events and 1.7% vs 1.8% of serious adverse events respectively [51]).The paper also points to the fact that brain inflammatory responses have long been recognized as a factor in etiology of many neurodegenerative diseases like autism and provides a host of citations for that as well.They (Dr, Shaw and Dr. Tomljenovic) also published a paper in 2011 that was approved for publication in theJournal of Inorganic Biochemistrythat stated:We show that Al-adjuvanted vaccines may be a significant etiological factor in the rising prevalence of ASD. According to the FDA, vaccines represent a special category of drugs as they are generally given to healthy individuals. Further according to the FDA, this places significant emphasis on their vaccine safety. While the FDA does set an upper limit for Aluminum in vaccines at no more that 850/mcg/dose, it is important to note that this amount was selected empirically from data showing that Aluminum in such amounts enhanced the antigenicity of the vaccine, rather than from existing safety. Given that the scientific evidence appears to indicate that vaccine safety is not as firmly established as often believed, it would seem ill advised to exclude paediatric vaccinations as a possible cause of adverse long-term neurodevelopment outcomes, including those associated with autism. (8)Shaw and Seneff also recently published a paper in the JournalImmunome Research outlining a lot of evidence pointing to the dangers regarding aluminum in vaccines. (9)A paper published in the peer reviewed International Journal ofEnvironmental Research and Public HealthtitledThimerosal Exposure and the Role of Sulfation Chemistry and Thiol Availability in Autismconcluded:With the rate of children diagnosed with an ASD in the US now exceeding 1 in 50 children and the rate of children withneurodevelopment/behavioural disorders in the US nowexceeding 1 in 6 children, and the preceding evidence showing that there is vulnerability to that would not be known without extensive testing, the preponderance of theevidence indicates that should be removed from all vaccines (10)A paper published in theJournal Entropy Identifiesseveral signs and symptoms that are significantly more prevalent in vaccine reports after 2000, including cellulitis, seizure, depression, fatigue, pain and death, which are also significantly associated with aluminum-containing vaccines. We propose that children with the autism diagnosis are especially vulnerable to toxic metals such as aluminum and mercury due to insufficient serum sulfate and glutathione. A strong correlation between autism and the MMR (Measles, Mumps, Rubella) vaccine is also observed, which may be partially explained via an increased sensitivity to acetaminophen administered to control fever. (source)A paper published in the Journal of ToxicologytitledB-Lymphocytes from a population of Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder and Their Unaffected Siblings Exhibit Hypersensitivity to Thimerosalclearly demonstrates that certain individuals with a mild mitochondrial defect may be highly susceptible to mitochondrial specific toxins like thimerosal. What does this mean? It means that people with a slight DNA difference are at risk for developing neurodegenerative diseases via vaccination. They determined that ASD patients have a heightened sensitivity to thimerosal which would restrict cell proliferation that is typically found after vaccination.(11)A study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutritiondetermined that an increased vulnerability to oxidative stress and decreased capacity for methylation may contribute to the development and clinical manifestation of autism. Its well known that viral infections cause increased oxidative stress. (12) Research suggeststhat metals, including those found in many vaccines are directly involved in increasing oxidative stress.Oxidative stress, brain inflammation and microgliosis have been heavily documented in association with toxic exposures including various heavy metals. (14)A study published in the Journal of Biomedical Sciencesdetermined that the autoimmunity to the central nervous system may play a causal role in autism. Researchers discovered that because many autistic children harbour elevated levels of measles antibodies, they should conduct a serological study of measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) and myelin basic protein (MBP) autoantibodies. They used serum samples of 125 autistic children and 92 controlled children. Their analysis showed a significant increase in the level of MMR antibodies in autistic children. The study concludes that the autistic children had an inappropriate or abnormal antibody response to MMR. The study determined that autism could be a result from an atypical measles infection that produces neurological symptoms in some children. The source of this virus could be a variant of MV, or it could be the MMR vaccine.(13)A study published in the International Journal of Toxicologyoutlines the biological plausibility of mercurys role in neurodevelopmental disorders. It suggests that early mercury exposure could indeed increase the risk of autism. (14)To sum up, there has been a great deal of information from different studies that seems to indicate that repetitive mercury exposure during pregnancy, through thimerosal, dental amalgam, and fish consumption, and after birth, through thimerosal-containing vaccinations and pollution, in genetically susceptible individuals is one potential factor in autism. (source)A study conducted by the Department of Paediatrics at the University of Arkansasdetermined that thimerosal-induced cytotoxicity was associated with the depletion of intracellular glutathione (GSH) in both cell lines.The study outlines how many vaccines have been neurotoxic, especially to the developing brain. Depletion of GSH is commonly associated with autism. Although thimerosal has been removed from most childrens vaccines, it is still present in flu vaccines given to pregnant women, the elderly and to children in developing countries. (15)The assertion that vaccine-autism concerns rest merely on spurious claims made by uneducated parents is in stark contrast with a large body of scientific literature. As mentioned previously, extensive research data has underscored the tight connection between development of the immune system and that of the CNS, and thus the plausibility that disruption of critical events in immune development may play a role in neurobehavioral disorders including those of the autism spectrum. Indeed, early-life immune challenges in critical windows of developmental vulnerability have been shown to produce long-lasting, highly abnormal cognitive and behavioral responses, including increased fear and anxiety, impaired social interactions, deficits in object recognition memory and sensorimotor gating deficits. These symptoms are highly characteristic of autism. It is thus indeed naive to assume that a manipulation of the immune system through an increasing number of vaccinations during sensitive periods of early development will not result in adverse neurological outcomes. Consistent with this, Shoenfeld and Cohen (worlds leading experts in autoimmune diseases) noted that, vaccines have a predilection to affect the nervous system [emphasis added]. Also, please refer to a number of publications we and others have authored on this subject (link between immune challenges and adverse neurological outcomes. For specific publications on the links between vaccinations and autism, refer to the following citations .

Tox Env Chem. 90, 997-1008.The list literally goes on and on, study after study in peer-reviewed scientific journals claim a possible link between vaccines/vaccine ingredients and autism.So, for the pro-vaccine community to say there is no link, and cant be a link, and that vaccines could not be one out of several possible causes contributing to the development of autism seems a little bit ridiculous, dont you think?As you can see above, there are many peer-reviewed studies published in scientific journals by experts at various institutions claiming no link. On the other hand, we have the same type of research, also in abundance that claims there could be a link, and that it is probable and through science theyve shown how.What are parents who do their research supposed to think when they come across this information? Why is the pro vac side so adamant on saying that there are no scientific peer-reviewed published studies that posit a potential link to autism when there are many.So, this is one reason why parents are choosing not to vaccinate their children. To say there is absolutely no way a vaccine can be a contributing factor in causing autism is completely false and dangerous.The medical profession is being bought by the pharmaceutical industry, not only in terms of the practice of medicine, but also in terms of teaching and research. The academic institutions of this country are allowingthemselvestobe the paid agents of the pharmaceutical industry. I think itsdisgraceful. (source)(source)Arnold Seymour Relman (1923-2014), Harvard Professor of Medicine and Former Editor-in-Chief of the New England Medical JournalWhen a parent points to the idea that scientific and industry fraud contributed to their decision to not vaccine their child, they can instantly be deemed conspiracy theorists or greeted with some sort of rude response that makes them out to be fools. This couldnt be further from the truth, and those types of responses often come from those who have failed to do any investigation for themselves.Condemnation without investigation is the height of ignorance.Here is why parents are actually pointing to scientific/industry fraud when it comes to making their decision, and to be honest, with this type of information out in the public domain, who can really blame them?Its hard to know where to start when there are so many examples:In the past few years more professionals have come forward to share a truth that, for many people, proves difficult to swallow. One such authorityisDr. Richard Horton, the current editor-in-chief of the Lancet considered to be one of the most well respected peer-reviewed medical journals in the world.Dr. Horton recently published a statement declaring thata lot of published researchis in fact unreliable at best, if not completely false.The case against science is straightforward: much of the scientific literature, perhaps half, may simply be untrue. Afflicted by studies with small sample sizes, tiny effects, invalid exploratory analyses, and flagrant conflicts of interest, together with an obsession for pursuing fashionable trends of dubious importance, science has taken a turn towards darkness. (source) Lucija Tomljenovic,who has a PhD in biochemistry and is a senior postdoctoral fellow in UBCs Faculty of Medicine, is also a medical investigator. A few years ago she uncovered documents that reveal vaccine manufacturers, pharmaceutical companies and health authorities have known about multiple dangers associated with vaccines but chose to withhold them from the public. This is scientific fraud, and suggests that this practice continues to this day. The documents were obtained from the UK Department of Health (DH) and the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunization (JCVI), who advise the Secretaries of State for Health in the UK about diseases preventable through immunizations. The JCVI made continuous efforts to withhold critical data on severe adverse reactions and contraindications to vaccinations to both parents and health practitioners in order to reach overall vaccination rates.The transcripts of the JCBI meetings also show that some of theCommittee members had extensive ties to pharmaceutical companies and that the JCVI frequently co-operated with vaccine manufactures on the strategies aimed at boosting vaccine uptake. Some of themeetings at which such controversial items were discussed were not intended to be publiclyavailable, as the transcripts were only released later,through the Freedom of Information Act (FOI). These particular meetings are denoted in the transcripts as commercial in confidence, and reveal a clear anddisturbing lack of transparency, as some of the information was removed from the text (i.e., the names of theparticipants) prior to transcript release under the FOI section at the JCVI website. (16)A congressional record from May 1, 2003 shows that there could be, and that many scientists themselves believe that there is a high risk of autism as a result of Thimerosal-containing vaccines. Again, this is a congressional report and parents who choose not to ignore it should not be bashed by others, dont you think? The report even shows information from the CDCs own Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) that postulates the vaccine-autism connection. (17) Insider whistle-blowers with verified credentials have also played a role with parents who areconcernedabout vaccinating theirchildren. This type of thing has been going on for quite a while. Take Robert F. Kennedy Jr for example. He repeatedly stated that there is a cover up of data that clearly shows a definitive link between vaccines and autism. He also alluded to the fact that he has met with some of these people, that they know what they are doing, and that they are terrified of the public ever finding out. Think about that for a second, we have the former presidents nephew, who has been in elitist circles and obviously in and around people whove held powerful positions making these comments. Of course these are concerning comments, and to not completely dismiss them as false isnt a bad thing. One of the biggest concerns for parents was the fact that he, in June 2005, authored an article in Rolling Stone and Salon.com alleging a government conspiracy to cover up connections between vaccines and autism. Both of the articles were retracted. (18)(19) There are many speeches he made, and compelling statements that are available in the form of articles and YouTube videos if you are interested in seeing more.Although a whistle-blower is not science, it does add to the science that is already there by giving it an extra leg so to speak. stuff like this seems to be cropping up every year giving parents more reasons not to vaccinate their children, just as it is cropping up every year giving parents more reasons to vaccinate their children.We also have statements (hundreds) from scientists and doctors like this one (quote below) which also seem to be contributing to a lack of trust for vaccine manufacturers and the studies they sponsor. Much of the published scientific studies that say there is no need to worry about vaccines, and that there is no autism link are actually sponsored by the vaccine manufactures themselves:It is simply no longer possible to believe much of the clinical research that is published, or to rely on the judgement of trusted physicians or authoritative medical guidelines. I take no pleasure in this conclusion, which I reached slowly and reluctantly over my two decades as an editor of the New England Journal of Medicine (considered to be one of the most prestigious peer-reviewed medical journals in the world). Dr Marcia Angell, Physician, Author, Former Editor in Chief of the NEJM (20)A more recent example (and perhaps one of the biggest) would be long time CDC scientist, Dr. William Thompson. In fact, he has authored and co-authored dozens of studies, many of which are commonly pointed out by the pro-vaccine movement. A couple of them are actually cited above that show there is no link between vaccines and autism. Just a few months ago this is what he had to say:The CDC has put the research 10 years behind, because the CDC has not been transparent. Weve missed 10 years of research because the CDC is so paralyzed right now by anything related to autism. Really what we need is for congress to come in and say, give us the data. (22)He pointed to a specific study that he co-authored,a 2004 CDC study commonly cited and used by the scientific community, among others, that determined:The evidence is now convincing that the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine does not cause autism or any particular subtypes of autism spectrum disorder. (21)He also alluded to another study published in theJournal of Pediatricsthat concluded:The evidence is now convincing that the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine does not cause autism or any particular subtypes of autism spectrum disorder. (23)This is what he had to say about that study:Its the lowest point in my career that I went along with that paper and uh, I went along with this, we didnt report significant findings. Im completely ashamed of what I did, I have great shame now that I was complicit and went along with this, I have been a part of the problem.(22)This story was becoming so big across alternative news networks, like CE, that mainstream media outlets like CNN picked up on it as quick as they could and tried to spin the story. At least they admitted that yes, Dr. Thompson did actually blow the whistle:I regret that my co-authors and I omitted statistically significant information in our 2004 article, Thompson said in a statement sent to CNN by his lawyer. I have had many discussions with Dr. Brian Hooker over the last 10 months regarding studies the CDC has carried out regarding vaccines and neurodevelopmental outcomes, including autism spectrum disorders. I share his belief that CDC decision-making and analyses should be transparent. (24)(25)That being said, he also said in an official statement from his lawyers on August 27th 2014.I want to be absolutely clear that I believe vaccines have saved and continue to save countless lives. I would never suggest that any parent avoid vaccinating children of any race. Vaccines prevent serious diseases, and the risks associated with their administration are vastly outweighed by their individual and societal benefits. (25)This brings me to my next point. With regards to the data omitted above,Dr. Thompson made the call to scientist Dr. Brian Hooker (22)(24)(25), who published the real findings which found that there was a 340 percent increased chance of autism in African American boys receiving the MMR vaccine on time. The study was published in the peer-reviewed journalTranslational Neurodegeneration and was retracted a couple of days later.(26) This is why I am linking it here and not with the studies above (first point).That being said, Dr. Hooker has published a number of peer-reviewed studies that have appeared in reputable scientific journals. The journalTranslational Neurodegeneration being one, where his studyprovided epidemiological evidence supporting an association between increasing organic-Hg exposure from Thimerosal-containing childhood vaccines and the risk of an ASD diagnosis. (27) Furthermore, an abstract obtained by Hooker showsincreased risk of developmental neurologic impairment after high exposure to thimerosal-containing vaccine in the first month life. (28)Here is a video of a pro-vaccine congressman telling us about this case.As you can see, parents who cite scientific/industry fraud as one of the reasons for not vaccinating their child holds a great deal of validity. Most vaccine supporters are completely unaware of this information, which is understandable, its not really out there so to speak, its something you have to look for. These are just a few of many examples, as I am trying to make this article as short as possible (not easy).During the mid-1970s, there was an increased focus on personal health and more people became concerned about vaccine safety. Several lawsuits were filed against vaccine manufacturers and healthcare providers by people who believed they had been injured by vaccines, and the evidence presented in court was good enough to win.As a result, this act was developed to protect any pharmaceutical company, doctor or medical association from any fault. Its not about pointing fingers, many people really do believe that every vaccine is fine to inject into somebody. Instead of suing the vaccine manufacturer directly, they have to go through a long process where parents have to ask the government to admit that the vaccine was responsible for their childs injury, and ask for compensation for the childs care.Pharmaceutical companies are exempt from participating in these proceedings, and tax payers are the ones who pay for all the",TRUE
Mercury & Vaccines,http://robertfkennedyjr.com/mercury-vaccines/,"I am pro vaccine. I had all of my six children vaccinated. I believe that vaccinessavemillionsoflives. SoletmeexplainwhyI edited the book Thimerosal: Let The Science Speak, which exposes the dangerousand wholly unnecessaryuse of the mercury-based preservative thimerosal in vaccines being given to millions of children and pregnant women here and around the world.Vaccines are big business. Pharma is a trillion-dollar industry with vaccines accounting for $25 billion in annual sales. CDCs decision to add a vaccine to the schedule can guarantee its manufacturer millions of customers and billions in revenue with minimal advertis- ing or marketing costs and complete immunity from lawsuits. High stakes and the seamless marriage between Big Pharma and government agencies have spawned an opaque and crooked regulatory system. Merck, one of Americas leading vaccine outfits, is currently under investigation for deceiving FDA regulators about the effectiveness of its MMR vaccine. Two whistleblowers say Merck ginned up sham studies to maintain Mercks MMR monopoly.Big money has fueled the exponential expansion of CDCs vaccine schedule since 1988, when Congress grant of immunity from lawsuitssuddenly transformed vaccines into paydirt. CDC recommended five pediatric vaccines when I was a boy in 1954. Todays children cannot school without at least 56 doses of 14 vaccines by the time theyre 18.An insatiable pharmaceutical industry has 271 new vaccines under development in CDCs bureaucratic pipeline in hopes of boosting vaccine revenues to $100 billion by 2025. The industrys principle spokesperson, Dr. Paul Offit, says that he believes children can take as many as 10,000 vaccines.Public health may not be the sole driver of CDC decisions to mandate new vaccines. Four scathing federal studies, including two by Congress, one by the US Senate, and one by the HHS Inspector General, paint CDC as a cesspool of corruption, mismanagement, and dysfunction with alarming conflicts of interest suborning its research, regulatory, and policymaking functions. CDC rules allow vaccine industry profiteers like Dr. Offit to serve on advisory boards that add new vaccines to the schedule. In a typical example, Offit in 1999 sat on the CDCs vaccine advisory committee and voted to add the rotavirus vaccine to CDCs schedule, paving the way for him to make a fortune on his own rotavirus vaccine. Offit and his business partners sold the royalties to his rotavirus vaccine patent to Merck in 2006 for $182 million. Offit told Newsweek, It was like winning the lottery! A 2009 HHS Inspector Generals report found that the CDC certified financial disclosure forms with at least one omission for 97% of committee membersand most forms had more than one type of omission. The same report stated that as many as 64% of committee members had potential conflicts of interest that CDC did not identify or resolve before certifying their forms. In addition to lucrative business partnerships with Merck, Offit holds a $1.5 million research chair, funded by Merck, at Childrens Hospital in Philadelphia. From this industry sinecure, he broadcasts vaccine industry propaganda and annually publishes books urging unlimited vaccinations and vilifying safe-vaccine advocates.The corruption has also poisoned CDCs immunization safety office, the research arm that tests vaccines for safety and efficacy. In August 2014, seventeen-year CDC veteran, Dr. William Thompson, who is author of the principal study cited by CDC to exculpate mercury- preserved vaccines from the autism link, invoked whistleblower protection, and turned extensive agency files over to Congress. Thompson, who is still employed at CDC, says that for the past decade his superiors have pressured him and his fellow scientists to lie and manipulate data about the safety of the mercury-based preservative thimerosal to conceal its causative link to a suite of brain injuries, including autism.Thimerosal is 50% ethylmercury, which is far more toxic and persistent in the brain than the highly regulated methylmercury in fish. Hundreds of peer reviewed studies by leading government and university scientists show that thimerosal is a devastating brain poison linked to neurological disorders now epidemic in American children. My book, Thimerosal: Let the Science Speak, is a summary of these studies, which CDC and its credulous jour- nalists swear dont exist. Although Thompsons CDC and vaccine industry colleagues have created nine patently fraudulent and thoroughly discredited epidemiological studies to defend thimerosal, no published study shows thimerosal to be safe.* Please click the headline link above or here for all source annotationsThe common canard that US autism rates rose after drug makers removed most thimerosal from pediatric vaccines in 2003 is wrong. That same year, CDC added flu shots containing massive doses of thimerosal to the pediatric schedule. As a result, children today can get nearly as much mercury exposure as children did from all pediatric vaccines combined in the decade prior to 2003. Worse, thimerosal, for the first time, is being given to pregnant women in flu shots. Furthermore, CDCs current autism numbers are for children born in 2002, when kids were still getting thimerosal in their pediatric vaccines. The best science suggests that thimerosals complete removal from vaccines is likely to prompt a significant decline in autism. For example, a 2013 CDC study in JAMA Pediatrics shows a 33% drop in autism spectrum disorder in Denmark following the 1992 removal of thimerosal from Danish vaccines. That paper is among 37 peer-reviewed studies linking thimerosal to the autism epidemic.Thimerosal has precipitated a journalistic as well as a public health crisis. Big Pharma pumps over $3.5 billion annually into TV, newspapers, and other advertising, targeting news departments, which have become vehicles for pharmaceutical sales and propa- ganda platforms for the industry. Television and print outlets feature spokespeople like Dr. Offitwithout identifying their industry ties while censoring criticisms of vaccine safety andexcluding the voices of informed vaccine safety advocates. Busy journalists parrot the deceptive talking points dispensed by government and pharma officials rather than reading the science themselves. Unable to argue the science, they bully, pillory, and demonize vaccine safety advocates as anti-vax, anti-science, and far worse. The unwillingness of the press to scrutinize CDC has emboldened both industry and agency to follow the lowest paths of easy profit and bureaucratic preservation.The measles scare was classic disaster capitalism, with media outlets dutifully stoking public hysteria on editorial pages and throughout the 24-hour broadcast cycle. With Dr. Offit leading the charge, CDC, drug makers, and industry-funded front groups parlayed a garden variety annual measles outbreak into a national tidal wave of state legislation to ban religious and philosophical vaccine exemptions. The national media frenzy over 159 measles cases left little room for attention to the the autism cataclysm which has debilitated 1 million American children since the pandemic began in 1989, with 27,000 new cases annually. CDC refuses to call autism an epidemic. In defiance of hard science, and common sense, CDC and Offit have launched a denial campaign to gull reporters into believing the autism plague is an illusion created by better diagnosis.Big Pharma is among the nations largest political donors, giving $31 million last year to national political candidates. It spends more on political lobbying than any other industry, $3.0 billion from 1998 to 2014double the amount spent by oil and gas and four times as much as defense and aerospace lobbyists. By February, state legislators in 36 states were pushing through over one hundred new laws to end philosophical and religious vaccine exemptions. Many of those state lawmakers are also on the industry payroll. You can see how much money bill sponsors from your state took from Big Pharma on http://www.maplight.orgNormally plaintiffs tort lawyers would provide a powerful check and balance to keep vaccines safe and effective and regulators and policymakers honest. But Pharmas dirty money has bought the industry immunity from lawsuits for vaccine injury no matter how dangerous the product. An obliging Congress disposed of the Seventh Amendment right to jury trial, making it impossible for vaccine-injured plaintiffs to sue pharmaceutical companies for selling unsafe vaccines. Thats right! No Class Actions. No discovery. No depositions and little financial incentive for the industry to make vaccines safer.Vaccine industry money has neutralized virtually all of the checks and balances that once stood between a rapacious pharmaceutical industry and our children. With the re- search, regulatory, and policymaking agencies captured, the courts closed to the public, the lawyers disarmed, the politicians on retainer and the media subverted, there is no one left to stand between a greedy industry and vulnerable children, except parents. Now Big Pharmas game plan is to remove parental informed consent rights from that equation and force vaccine hesitant parents to inject their children with potentially risky vaccines that the Supreme Court has called unavoidably unsafe.Ending exemptions is premature until we have a functioning regulatory agency and a transparent process. The best way to insure full vaccine coverage is for the vaccine program to win back public trust by ending its corrupt financial ties with a profit-making industry.To educate yourselves about CDC corruption and the truth about vaccine science, I hope you will read Thimerosal: Let the Science Speak and download the important movie Trace Amounts43 and insist your legislators watch it before voting on any of these bills.",MISINFORMED
The Conclusive Evidence Linking Vaccines and Autism,http://visionlaunch.com/the-conclusive-evidence-linking-vaccines-and-autism/,"The vaccine autism argument can be confusing when debating the facts, because from our research, there are several different factors at play when it comes to autism, not just the mercury based compound, Thimerosal. The reason for the ambiguity is because our health officials tell us that they have removed Thimerosal from vaccines and we still see autism cases on the rise, so it cannot be the Thimerosal (or vaccines) causing autism.They also present the public with several dubiousstudies in which we are told concludes that there is no evidence linking the two. Case closed. No further testing needed. Which is one of the problems we see in our health officials approach to autism. We have an autism epidemic in this country where more than 1 out of every 50 children is being diagnosed. Unfortunately, vaccine manufacturers and health officials are more interested in excluding vaccines as the cause than trying to find a remedy to stop this national tragedy.To put the rise in autism in the proper perspective, very few, if any of the infectious diseases that our children are being vaccinated for, come even close to a 1 in 50 prevalence rate. While they are certainly not as bad as an autism diagnosis, they are called outbreaks and epidemics. The real epidemic we are witnessing is the catastrophic rise in autistic children in our country. Its not childhood infectious diseases that pose the biggest threat to our children, and our health officials know this.This rise in autism is not due tobetter diagnoseslike we aretold, either. If that were the case, we would see scores of 50 and 60 year old people with autism in our population. How many people over 50 years old do you know with autism? Certainly not 1 in 50, or even 1 in 5,000, for that matter. The truth is, the spike in autism is a recent phenomenon and has become a real threat to our society. If left unaddressed, we can expect millions of people in our country to not only become non-productive members of our community, but to be unable to care for their own basic needs. In part 9 of this article we take a comprehensive look at the many links between vaccines and autism, as well as our health officials attempts to cover up the evidence.When we look at the evidence, it is clear that our health officials know more than they are telling us. Judging by recent developments involving fraud, data trashing and cover-ups, it appears that they actually know a lot more. Unfortunately, vaccine manufacturers and health officials are fully engaged in agendas that center on self-protection and profit-making. By necessity, they are deeply committed to maintaining the message that vaccines are safe and effective. It would be in direct conflict with these agendas to try to identify causes or find remedies for theautism epidemic we face. This sad truth is in striking contrast to the image they each project namely, that public health organizations are truly concerned with public health and that pharmaceutical companies are in the business of health care. Neither could be further from the truth.We have anautismepidemic in this country, with a prevalence rate of 2.24%. This means that 1 in every 45 children is diagnosed with ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder). To put an ASD diagnosis in perspective, consider some of the childhood diseases vaccines are designed to prevent like chicken pox, measles, polio, pertussis or mumps. In first world conditions, children have an overwhelmingly good chance of recovering fully from any one of these illnesses and, in so doing, their immune systems become strengthened. When your child is diagnosed with measles, for example, it is not a life sentence. You dont go home and figure out how to rearrange your lives forever. While it is unpleasant and frightening, it is also typically a mild illness of limited duration. If your child is diagnosed with any of the childhood illnesses we vaccinate for, the prognosis is vastly better than for those receiving a diagnosis of ASD. There is no cure, per se, for autism and children do not generally recover from it.When we look at the first chart below we see that the rise in autism has increased in lockstep with the timeline of CDCs increasing vaccine schedule, shown in the second chart. Since the 1970s the recommended vaccine schedule in the U.S. has increased by more than 400%. Over the past 40 years, there has been no uptick, no epidemic and no new knowledge uncovered to warrant such a drastic increase in vaccines in order to protect public health.Please note that 2009 is the last year reflected on the graph below. If you add the numbers from the last 6 years, you would see the blue line continue its steep upward trajectory, reflecting an autism epidemic. The CDC conducted a national health interview and, based on data from 2011-2014, CDC reports that the incidence of ASD is actually 1 in 45 children, or 2.24%. This information is taken directly from the CDC National Health Reports Statistics Bulletin 87, published in November, 2015.While the graph below illustrates the history of a remarkable increase in vaccines,keep in mind that there are almost 300 new vaccines in thedevelopmentpipeline. Imagine how this graph will look in a few short years, if left unchecked.What is the effect of combining dozens of vaccine ingredients in our childrens developing immune systems in such a concentrated time-frame? Answer: we dont know. This may seem shocking to most people, but after almost 30 years of an increasingly aggressive vaccine schedule and scores of children developing autism and many other health issues, our health officials have not done studies of the combined effect of even 3 vaccines, let alone 8-13 that they can receive in one visit. All the studies about vaccines are only based on receiving one vaccine at a time.How can our health officials say that vaccines do not cause autism in the absence of the fundamental knowledge needed to make such a statement? They cant! Its not possible. Without performing studies on the combined effects of multiple vaccines at once, it is impossible to rule out vaccines as a possible cause for autism or any other diseases our children have developed over the last few decades. And anyone who says that vaccines dont cause autism cannot be considered as credible, plain and simple. As you will see from the evidence presented in this part, our officials know there is a link between vaccines and autism but they are doing everything in their power to hide the facts.You have heard it over and over: our public health officials are taking a blatantly anti-scientific stance on the topic. They dont care to elaborate muchbeyondciting the overwhelming number of studies showing that vaccines dont cause autism. In perhaps their most defensive stance to date, our public health officials tell us the case is closed and no further testing is needed. Vaccines do not cause autism, it has been decided. What true scientists would ever say that their findings are definitive and that no further research is warranted? The very nature of science is to gather information on an ongoing basis andtoallow new findings to influence and redefine what we thought we knew. The CDC, the FDA, the WHO all tell us: case closed. Really? Taking a suspiciously unquestionable perspective, CDC tells us not only that vaccines dont cause autism but that there is not even a connection. Such a distinct and concerted effort to shut down the conversationwould make it appear that perhaps much more is at stake than scientific truth.There are a number of talking points on the un-publishable public health agenda regarding vaccines and autism, which are recited over and over by our media and by the multitudes of those on the payrolls of the pharmaceutical industry, including our public health officials. The talking points are listed below, along with a refutation of each of them.False. One of the arguments you might hear from public health officials is that the huge rise in ASD is due to better diagnosis. Once data from the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) was finally released by the US Department of Health and Human Services, however, this argument was found to be invalid.Think about how many people you know over 50 who have autism. Our guess is none. The truth is that the spike in autism is a recent phenomenon and has become a real threat to our society. If left unaddressed, what can we expect from the next generations of adults? What about their children? In part 9 of this article we take a comprehensive look at the many links between vaccines and autism, as well as our health officials collective determination to end the conversation.False.We are told by people like Dr. Richard Pan, co-author of the SB277 bill thatThimerosal is not in childhood vaccinesbut that is not true. Thimerosal was not eliminated from all childhood vaccines.In 1999, the the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended removing Thimerosal from vaccines routinely given to infants. Instead of removing all existing vaccines that contained Thimerosal, which drug makers said they could do and have new batches in short order, the CDC opted to let the existing stock run out before ordering new ones, which took two to three years. CDC reports that in 2001, (e)xcept for influenza (flu), thimerosal is removed from or reduced in all vaccines routinely recommended for children 6 years of age and under manufactured for the U.S. market.To this day, the influenza vaccine still has toxic amounts of mercury, in the form of Thimerosal and the flu shot is most definitely on the CDC Childhood Vaccine Schedule. Around the time that Thimerosal-laden vaccine stock was being used up from the other vaccines, the influenza vaccine was being recommended for use in infants and pregnant women. In spite of the fact that the influenza vaccine has not ever been shown to be safe for either group.Also, as Thimerosal was phased out of some vaccines, increasing and equal amounts of aluminum were replacing the mercury.More on aluminum in vaccines later in this part.False.Actually, this is a clever retort but fairly devoid of any real meaning. The truth is that the fish we consume has far, far less mercury than a single flu vaccine (see graphic below) and yet our health officials warn moms to be to avoid eating too much fish when pregnant. Vaccines contain methylmercury while ethylmercury is the type found in fish. A 2013 study points out the absurdity of public health officialss stance on mercury:Although ethylmercury (eHg) is considered a hazardous substance that is to be avoided even at small levels when consumed in foods such as seafood and rice (in Asia), the World Health Organization considers small doses of Thimerosal safe regardless of multiple/repetitive exposures to vaccines that are predominantly taken during pregnancy or infancy. The study goes on to find that the two types of mercury appear to have similar dangers and that, in combination, they have a distinct toxokinetic profile, which is particularly dangerous.Another critical point is that when consumed in food, our bodies have processes for limiting absorption and excreting a portion of heavy metals like the mercury found in Thimerosal. This is not true for injected mercury, which may leave the bloodstream but reside in the brain and tissues throughout the body. Blood samples, therefore, will likely not tell the whole story about mercury exposure. Unused/expired vaccines that contain Thimerosal areconsidered hazardous waste and must be disposed of according to specific safety guidelines due their mercury content.False.When our health officials make such a definitive statement, we expect that they have lots of irrefutable evidence to back it up. CDC actually says that when used in vaccines, Thimerosal is no longer a toxin, but actually just becomes a preservative. Their boldness in this statement alludes to conclusive evidence (and some kind of strange alchemy) which, unfortunately, has translated into unmerited public confidence in the message and the messenger. When our public health officials say something with such certainty, we expect to find an abundance of supporting evidence for their claim. Lets delve deeper, considering that evidence firsthand.Despite what the media and our healthcare officials constantly tell us, the fact of the matter is, we have conclusive evidence that links vaccines and autism, but it cannot be admitted by anyone in any official capacity. If this connection is admitted, it will open a Pandoras box, signaling a cascade effect whereby more and more people decline vaccines and demand safety research before granting their consent. It will set a precedent. If the general public knows there is a link between vaccines and autism, vaccine uptake will drop precipitously, litigation will dramatically increase and the vaccine mandate itself will be in serious jeopardy. Not to mention the profound effect it will have on the pharmaceutical industry. This is why it must be viciously defended at all costs.All one would need to do is look at the Hannah Poling case or the Bailey Banks case in which the government conceded that vaccines were, in fact, the reason for their childrens autism like symptoms (or autism). They parse their words carefully in their decisions and press releases, but thats essentially their rulings. The Poling and Banks cases are not unique.Here is an article titled Vaccine Court Awards Millions to Two Children With Autism which addresses these cases which were compensated for autism like symptoms. The Vaccine Injury Compensation Program has since been very careful about how they define autism for the exact reason I stated above, to avoid setting precedent.But there are a lot more than just four cases. Now we hear terms like encephalitis (brain swelling) and vaccine induced encephalopathy (brain disease) because the autism term is just too emotionally and politically charged. In the end, these are all forms of brain injuries to varying degrees. In fact it is common knowledge to those close to NVICP that if you are seeking compensation for your vaccine-injured child, you had better not mention the word autism, or you will never ever get a hearing.A May, 2011studypublished in the Pace Environmental Law Review concluded that the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) compensated 83 cases in which the court acknowledged vaccine inducedencephalopathy and seizure disorders that included autism or autism-like symptoms. Here are30 scientific studiesthat show vaccines can cause autism from the whale.to site.In June, 2000, a secret meeting was convened at SimpsonwoodConference & Retreat Center in Norcross, Georgia, near CDC headquarters. In attendance were CDC, FDA and WHO scientists and consultants, as well as those representing pharmaceutical companies. Participants were warned that the information under review was embargoed, meaning that no papers were allowed to leave the room and copying documents was prohibited. The meeting was titled Scientific Review of Vaccine Safety Datalink Information.The meeting was scheduled in response to a CDC epidemiologists findings six months earlier, which showed conclusive evidence of a link between vaccines and autism. The CDC epidemiologist was Dr. Thomas Verstraeten and he was the lead researcher tasked with determining the link between neurodevelopmental disorders and the mercury-based Thimerosal in vaccines. After analyzing the massive CDC database, Vaccine Safety Datalink, (VSD) Dr. Verstraeten found a clear correlation between vaccines andneurodevelopmental disorders, including autism. (We cite this unpublished study later in this article.)It was only through many FOIA requests (freedom of information act) thatthe public wasable to discover what went on at theSimpsonwood Conference. Putchildrenfirst.orghas compiled extensive information on the events leading up to this meeting which includes the transcript of the meetingitself as well as much of the internal communicationsamong the people directly involved. When we look at the internal correspondence leading up to the meeting, its clear that they are far more concerned about concealing the vaccines-autism link that about the children who were injured. Dr. Coleen Boyle, who was the Assistant Director for Science at the CDC,sent an email to Dr. Frank Destefano from the CDC asking if he considered excluding the data with highest risk age group for autism from the study. As Dr. Healy points out in part one of this article, this is called data mis-coding and although it is scientific misconduct, it is a common practice used to manipulate a studys findings to show favorable results.As a result of Dr. Verstraetens findings, the AAP (American Academy of Pediatrics) and Public Health Service put out a joint statement asking for the elimination of Thimerosal from vaccines, among a list of additional necessary actions. Here is what they stated in the joint release:These doctors are clearly troubled about Dr.Verstraetens findings and in their own words, each of them acknowledges that there is a link between vaccines and autism. After all this, what do you think happened to the studys conclusion? It took Dr. Verstraeten three years to publish the findings from his research but, true to form regarding CDC treatment of non-conforming research, they suppressed it. The final published study was a whitewash, removing or minimizing all autism-vaccine links.Here is how Safe Minds described the CDCs handling of this:Even with the CDCs conscious manipulation of the studys findings, the evidence was so overwhelming that the link between vaccines and autism could not go undetected.To see how the CDC removed vaccines association to autism click here.Dr. William Thompson, a senior epidemiologist employed by the CDC, has admitted that he and his co-authors destroyed data at the behest of his superiors at CDC, which conclusively links Mercks MMR vaccine to an over 300% rise in autism for African-American males under age 3. The only reason we know about this is that Dr. Thompson was secretly recorded confessing to the deed. Fortunately, Dr. Thompson saved all the original hard copies of the study claiming he knew it would be a crime to destroy the data, just in case of a DOJ inquiry. These documents (100,000 of them) have been handed over to congress and a select few news outlets. The conclusion of this study was obviously a problem for the CDC scientist from the beginning, as evidenced by his letter (shown below) to the then head of the CDC, Dr. Julie Gerberding.It is important to note that CDC came out with a statement essentially admitting that they omitted the data referred to byDr. Thompson. So what happened to Dr. Thompsons co-authors and his superiors at CDC? His co-authors were promoted within CDC and Dr. Julie Gerberding, head of CDC at the time,went on to head up the Merck vaccine division, where she has held almost $5 million of stockand where she enjoys a substantial pay increase.Quid pro quo?Here we have a Merck employee who reported to his superiors his research showing that Thimerosal did not even work as an anti-microbial component and feared that Merck could be poisoning infants who received vaccines containing Thimerosal. His research was passed on as high as scientists at the vice presidential level. He was told not to publish his findings. Here is a PDF file of a draft of a letter sent to the Chief Investigative Counsel, Lauren Fuller.Mercury, in the form of Thimerosal, remains a deeply concerning adjuvant in relation to autism, but it is not the only culprit. Aluminum is also a heavy metal and pharmaceutical companies useincreasing and equal amounts of aluminum to replace the toxic mercury based Thimerosal. Lest you get the impression that aluminum is a kinder or gentler adjuvant, you should know that like mercury, aluminum is also a known neurotoxin. It has been proven to cause devastating brain and central nervous system damage in mice in recent studies.Current ideology is suggesting a more complex connection between vaccines and autism than a simple causal relationship. True enough, Thimerosal, aluminum and any number of vaccine additives are cause for serious concern in and of themselves, but researchers are now talking about a more nuanced, dynamic interaction than what was historically suspected.Below is a short, 8 minute video of an interview with Stephanie Seneff, PhD. She is aseniorresearch scientist at the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. She is not a medical doctor and this may be precisely why she has been so free to explore and research the question of autism as it relates to environmental toxins, including aluminum in vaccines. Not trained or funded by the pharmaceutical or chemical industries, she is not beholden to them. Obviously inquisitive and brilliant, Dr. Seneff hasaworld-class skill set with which to tackle some obvious questions about the cause of the autism epidemic we face. Listen as she explains her theory regarding the role of vaccine adjuvants, and aluminum in particular, in causing autism.Dr. Seneff also talks about the synergistic effects vaccines have when combined with the compound glyphosate. Glyphosate is found in the pesticides used throughout our agriculture industry, particularly with genetically modified foods. Dr. Seneff has found an additional correlation between the combination of the chemicals in vaccines and glyphosate.After the controversy in the late 1990s and early 2000s regarding Thimerosal in vaccines, instead of removing it from vaccines like the AAP recommended, the CDC opted to let the stock run out. What is seldom talked about is that when the CDC phased out the vaccines containing mercury, pharmaceutical companies replaced it with increasing amounts of an equally deadly and toxic substance called aluminum sulfate.There are researchers who have studied the amount of aluminum in combined vaccination doses who say that it is even more dangerous than Thimerosal. Health officials will tell you that we ingest a certain amount of aluminum through our environment, but theres a big difference between ingesting and injecting. Dr. Chris Shaw conducted research on the effects of injected aluminum in lab mice.Dr. Chris Shaw conducted a study on aluminums effects in a biological organism by mimicking the vaccine schedule using lab mice.After the mice were injected with the aluminum, they were studied. The mice showed deteriorating motor skills as well as cognitive damage soon after being injected. When the animals brains were studied they showed massive damage to motor neurons.To make matters worse, with the aggressive vaccine schedule we are now adhering to, mercury and aluminum are often combined along with a whole host of other chemical vaccine ingredients. We have no idea and no research about how all of these vaccines and additives are interacting with each other.The University of Pittsburgh Study:There is a study (one of the very few of its kind) from the University of Pittsburgh that was presented in 2008. The research involved injecting monkeys with the same vaccine schedule children received from 1994-1999. The vaccinated monkeys developed autism like reactions. The control group of un-vaccinated monkeys displayed no such symptoms. The principal researcher, Laura Hewitson, has been scrutinized for not revealing that her own child is vaccine injured and that she filed a claim with the VICP. This has been characterized as an irreconcilable conflict of interest and has been the subject of a robust attempt to discredit her and this research. To my knowledge, there have been no attempts to replicate her findings but many attempts to bury the story. Dr. Hewitsons case is an example of a stunningly effective astroturf campaign that made a big story appear to be irrelevant in the public eye. She is a prime example of what happens when your research findings are out of alignment with the powers that be.This short video explains the first 11 cases of autismin the 1930sand traces their relationship to the commercial use of mercury, via Thimerosal.Thimerosal was added to vaccines in 1931. The very first case of autism in the U.S. was diagnosed in the mid 1930sby Dr. Leo Kanner. When Thimerosal was tested back in the 1930s it killed animals in very small doses. Even so, they still added it to a number of medical products, including vaccines.Most people are unaware of the fact that there have been no studies on the safety of Thimerosal since the original ones done almost 80 years ago. Does it seem right that we are injecting ourselves and our children witha known neurotoxin, classified as a hazardous material, which hasnt been safety tested sincethe 1930s? What about the fact that the only existing safety tests on Thimerosal showed it to be lethal?The following is an excerpt from the Mercury in Medicine Report, by Indiana Representative Dan Burton in 2003:If you want to learn more about the history of autism and its relation to Thimerosal, there is an excellent slideshowmade by Focus Autism that illustrates the relationship between the two. I have only included a few slides, but I would recommend that you review the whole slideshow, which can be viewed here.Boyd Haley is Professor Emeritus of Chemistry at University of Kentucky and a strong and knowledgeable voice about the dangers of mercury.According to Neil Z. Miller, in his 2016 book Milers Review of Critical Vaccine Studies, there are at least 180 studies showing that Thimerosal is harmful. Below are just a few of these studies, with quotes from the findings in red.**This exact same study was published almost four years later, but the findings had changed. The findings were changed to reflect the opposite of the initial findings, although the data was the same.As the overwhelming evidence clearly shows, there are many links between vaccines and autism but as we mentioned earlier, it cannot be admitted by our health officials for the reasons we stated. The medical establishment, media, and pharmaceutical companies have spent too much time and energy trying to convince us otherwise and an admission now would onlyprove that vaccine skeptics were correct all along and that is a Rubicon they just cannot cross. This is a very unfortunate situation that we are at the point where our health officials have blatantly lied to us when they know the truth about autism and vaccines.What this also shows us is that our health officials are willing to put the safety of children at risk in order to carry out their own agendas, so we will have to excuse vaccine skeptics if they do not trust the recommendations of these agencies.It is quite ironic because Dr. Andrew Wakefields research pointed to the same conclusions as all this evidence linking vaccines and autism, yet he was viciously attacked for it. Looks like he was right all along. Maybe thats why his co-author was completely exonerated on all the charges that were brought in conjunction with their study.This is Part 9 in the 12 part series: A Comprehensive Review ofVaccinesPart 1: Why Are So many People Choosing Not To Vaccinate?Part 4:How The CDC, FDA and WHO Lost the Trust of Vaccine SkepticsPart 6:What Are The Real Risks of Not Vaccinating in the U.S.?Part 7: Herd Immunity, Shedding and the Questionable Science Behind VaccinesPart 8:Did Vaccines Really Eradicate Infectious Diseases in the 20th Century?Part 10:Why Dont We Hear The Whole Story About Vaccines?Part 11: What Are Independent Experts Telling Us About Vaccines?",MISINFORMED
Fake news is what you get when the mainstream media tells you vaccines are completely safe,http://www.naturalnews.com/056161_fake_news_mainstream_media_vaccines.html,"(NaturalNews) The establishment media, which is pretty much the propaganda division for the Democratic Party, is so livid that it could not help its self-anointed candidate, ""crooked"" Hillary Clinton, defeat a billionaire businessman and reality TV star, that it is grasping at any straw possible to explain it. One of the most implausible of all explanations is that Clinton was done in by a bunch of ""fake news"" spread by ""fake news sites."" No doubt ours is high on the lib media's list. But the reality is, when it comes to publishing truth, the alternative media is becoming the new mainstream media. We not only get it right, but we're not afraid to tell it like it is. And that includes so-called ""controversial"" subjects like forced vaccination. The establishment press, meanwhile, serves as little more than an echo chamber for establishment medicine and Big Pharma. That's why legacy news agencies continue to push vaccines and those who create them as legitimate – even when they're not. Talk about fake news. Consider the following as examples of the media's inability to be honest about vaccines: Paul Offit As we reported nearly a year ago, we caught The Wall Street Journal engaging in some reckless reporting the previous fall when they allowed millionaire vaccine industrialist Dr. Paul Offit, MD, to publish an opinion piece. In it, he alleged that the rise in respiratory infections was tied to a decrease in vaccination rates. Needless to say, Offit heaped praise on the efficacy of vaccines, while leaving out this small, but important, detail: He made his millions developing vaccines. The mini-biography at the conclusion of his piece conveniently left out this massive conflict of interest, notably that he is the inventor of the rotavirus vaccine RotaTeq, now recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to be given universally to all infants. Offit claimed that the rise in whooping cough, mumps and measles infections is due in large part to falling vaccination rates. But a closer examination found that this isn't the case at all. Researchers have noted that since the early part of this century, some of those receiving the mumps vaccine are still coming down with it. In April 2014, a mumps outbreak occurred at the Stevens Institute of Technology, but all of those who were infected had been fully vaccinated with two documented doses of the MMR shot. So that would mean one of two things: The vaccines are losing their efficacy, or they never really worked in the first place. But to suggest that more kids should be vaccinated anyway – as Offit did – is thoroughly dishonest, especially without revealing who he really is. Dr. Richard Pan In May 2015, we reported that Richard Pan, a California state senator who is a pediatrician by training, was caught taking campaign money from Big Pharma firms. And while that in and of itself might not be alarming, Pan was, at the time, pushing legislation through his chamber that would make it mandatory for all parents to vaccinate their children. The legislation eventually passed and was signed into law. ""I've personally witnessed the suffering caused by vaccine-preventable diseases, and all children deserve to be safe at school,"" Pan said, as reported by Reuters. If that's true, then no doubt he's also witnessed the ""suffering"" experienced by children who have adverse, dangerous reactions to vaccines. But no matter. His connection to the Big Pharma donations was never made public by the establishment media and, given his role in the passage of vaccine tyranny, it should have been. Autism risk And speaking of vaccines, the establishment press has regularly pooh-poohed any suggestion that they are tied to an increase in autism rates – even though the government's own documents prove it. As we reported in September 2014, documents that were hidden from public view for decades, prove that the MMR vaccine can indeed lead to higher incidences of autism. And in March of this year, Natural News founder/editor Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, reported that a Food and Drug Administration document also revealed the connection. The document, an insert sheet for the Tripedia vaccine, openly admits to the vaccine being linked to ""idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, SIDS, anaphylactic reaction, cellulitis, autism, convulsion/grand mal convulsion, encephalopathy, hypotonia, neuropathy, somnolence and apnea."" [Emphasis added] But that got virtually no coverage at all by the lapdog establishment media, which depends on Big Pharma ad dollars to remain in business (we don't). So, the next time you hear someone in the legacy press complaining about ""fake news"" leading to this political outcome or that, just remember who actually reports facts because they are facts – those of us in the so-called ""alternative"" media.

Is It Time for your Flu Shot or Extra Nutrition?,https://vactruth.com/2017/01/10/flu-shot-or-extra-nutrition/,"Its that time of year: flu season. Pharmacies are advertising their flu shots. Medical groups and physicians urge patients to get their vaccinations. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that everyone get vaccinated, including newborns, pregnant women, children and the elderly.Is there a better, safer way? What are the risks of the flu vaccine versus the relative benefits? It can be argued that improving nutrition during the winter months is a safer, more effective means to prevent flu and other respiratory illnesses.The majority of individuals still fail to realize that the flu vaccine is neither safe nor effective at preventing influenza. It is considered one of the most dangerous of all vaccinations.According to integrative physician Dr. Mercola, the influenza vaccination has been responsible for causing a serious neurological disease, Guillain-Barr Syndrome, which, in severe cases can cause paralysis and death. In 1976, there were 30 deaths caused by the swine flu vaccine, all in previously healthy adults. There are an estimated 3-6,000 cases of Guillain-Barre Syndrome each year.The flu vaccine is known to contain unsafe amounts of the neurotoxin mercury. Vaccines have also been found to increase inflammation in recipients, which, in pregnant women, is linked to brain damage in their newborns. [1]The US governments Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS), examining the years 2009-2010, discovered a significant 4,250% increase in fetal deaths after their pregnant mothers received flu vaccine. These statistics were confirmed by Dr. Gary Goldman and published in the Human and Environmental Toxicology Journal. [2]In the year 2013, 139 claims were settled by the US governments vaccine court, with 70 cases being compensated. Of the 70 compensated cases, 42 of them were for the flu vaccine, or 60% of the settled cases in which compensation was awarded for serious injury or death. Many of these cases were for Guillain-Barr Syndrome.This is significant evidence to the seriousness of the danger of the flu vaccine, especially when one considers that most individuals are unaware of the vaccine courts and a significant underreporting of vaccine injuries exists. [3]In a comprehensive report by Barbara Loe Fisher of the National Vaccine Information Center, Fisher revealed that several European scientific studies have shown that unvaccinated individuals were less likely to become ill with influenza and other respiratory illnesses, compared to those vaccinated. For the elderly, some flu vaccines were shown to have no effectiveness in preventing disease. Even the CDC admits to only a 50% effectiveness rate for the flu vaccine most years, with some years having a lower effectiveness rate, including zero effectiveness for elderly. [4]Since vaccinations for flu cannot guarantee prevention of influenza and may actually increase ones chances of becoming ill with influenza, or worse, it makes sense to look at other safer options for improving ones immune system. The following suggestions can be beneficial for both prevention and treatment of respiratory illness and flu.Flu vaccinations have caused serious disease and death, including miscarriages, Guillain-Barr Syndrome, and influenza. The influenza vaccine has been reported to be effective zero to 50% of the time.Safer practices exist to build ones immune system and stay healthy this winter. Some suggestions for avoiding illness include eating nutrient-dense foods, taking vitamins C and D, resting and detoxifying through Epsom salt baths.",MISINFORMED
The Toxic Science of Flu Vaccines,http://www.globalresearch.ca/the-toxic-science-of-flu-vaccines/5554257,"Joshua Hadfield was a normal, healthy developing child as a toddler. In the midst of the 2010 H1N1 swine flu frenzy and fear mongering about the horrible consequences children face if left unvaccinated, the Hadfield’s had Joshua vaccinated with Glaxo’s Pandermrix influenza vaccine.  Within weeks, Joshua could barely wake up, sleeping up to nineteen hours a day.  Laughter would trigger seizures.  Joshua was diagnosed with narcolepsy, “an incurable, debilitating condition” associated with acute brain damage.[1]  Today we can look back at Pandermrix as a horrible vaccine.  Research indicates that it was associated with a 1400% increase in narcolepsy risk. More recently, a team of Finnish scientists at Finland’s National Institute for Health and Welfare, recorded 800 cases of narcolepsy associated with this vaccine.  Vaccine ingredients other than the engineered viral antigen are most often believed to be the primary culprits to adverse vaccine reactions. The Finnish research, on the other hand, indicated that the vaccine’s altered viral nucleotide likely contributed to the sudden rise in sleeping sickness.[2] Although Pandermrix was pulled from the market, it should never have been approved and released in the first place.  This is a classic case of regulatory negligence by health officials and the WHO which promulgates flu vaccines around the world.  Like all vaccines, which are now commonly fast tracked through government health regulatory bodies for rapid release upon the public, it should have been tested more thoroughly and more rigorously reviewed.  Since the time of Edward Jenner’s primitive inoculation experiments to combat smallpox, and its countless aftermath of deaths throughout the 19th century, modern vaccine science has failed to learn its lessons. The failure of proper regulatory oversight has resulted in Joshua and other British citizens becoming disabled for life. The British government has paid out over 63 million pounds to cover lawsuits to Pandermrix victims.  Glaxo has never admitted its flu vaccine caused brain damage. And this begs the question as to why it was withdrawn since it was the corporation’s single flagship vaccine against the swine flu.[3]  We shouldn’t become complacent by assuming flu vaccine risks only affect young children. Sarah Behie was 20 years old after receiving the flu shot.  Three weeks later her health deteriorated dramatically. Diagnosed with Guillain-Barre syndrome, a not uncommon adverse effect of influenza vaccination, four years later Sarah remains paralyzed from the waist down, incapable of dressing and feeding herself, and rotting away in hospitals and nursing homes.[4]  Joshua’s and Sarah’s stories are by no means unique. Today tens of thousands of infants, toddlers, children and adults across the nation are increasingly becoming victims of vaccine injuries. No national debate is initiated because regulatory malfeasance within federal health agencies has aligned its self interests with pharmaceutical profits rather than serving the public health.  Flu vaccines are perhaps the most ineffective vaccine on the market.  Repeatedly we are told by health officials that the moral argument for its continued use is for “the greater good,” although this imaginary good has never been defined scientifically. For the present 2016 flu season, the CDC has removed Medimmune’s live attenuated flu vaccine (LAIV) FluMist from the market because it was found to be ineffective.  Or at least this is the rationale stated by the agency. According to the CDC, one third of children’s influenza vaccinations are with live nasal sprays. Yet regardless of how infective and useless FluMist has been, it has remained on the market since 2003, and in 2014 the CDC recommended it as its flu vaccine of choice for children.[5]  Although last year FluMist was only 3% effective, according to an NBC report, the real truth behind its withdrawal is likely more crucial. [6] There is no reason to doubt that the vaccine contributed to more cases of flu infection than it prevented.  And this is a fundamental flaw with all live vaccines, and even killed attenuated ones, that have been shown to “shed” and infect people in contact with the vaccinated persons, especially those with compromised immune systems.  In her investigative report, “The Emerging Risks of Live Virus and Virus Vectored Vaccines,” Barbara Lo Fisher notes that the attenuated virus in the flu vaccine can shed and infect others for months after vaccination.  Both the unvaccinated and the vaccinated are at risk.  The CDC acknowledges this risk and warns “Persons who care for severely immunosuppressed persons who require a protective environment should not receive LAIV, or should avoid contact with such persons for 7 days after receipt, given the theoretical risk for transmission of the live attenuated vaccine virus.”[7]  At their best, flu vaccines remain around 50-60% effective according to official health statements. However, the World Health Organization’s predictions for 2014-2015 flu strains were a bust. The match was such a failure that the CDC was forced to warn the American public that the vaccine was only 23% effective.[8]  Given that the 2012-2013 flu season was only 27% effective for the 65 years-plus age group, predictive methodologies to determine which flu strains emerge during any given influenza season have more in common with medieval divination than sound science.  For the 1992-1993 and 1997-1998 seasons, the vaccine concoction of flu strains was only 16% effective. Katherine Severyn, who monitors the actual WHO predictions and compares them with CDC claims has stated that, “depending upon the study cited, [flu] vaccine efficacy actually ranges from a low of 0%.” [9]  Dr. David Brownstein has noted that as far back as 1999, the Journal of the American Medical Association reported increased risks of febrile disorders greater than placebo associated with the live vaccine.[10]  According to the FDA’s literature on FluMist, the vaccine was not studied for immunocompromised individuals (yet was still administered to them), and has been associated with acute allergic reactions, asthma, Guillian-Barre, and a high rate of hospitalizations among children under 24 months – largely due to upper respiratory tract infections.  Other adverse effects include pericarditis, congenital and genetic disorders, mitochondrial encephalomyopathy or Leigh Syndrome, meningitis, and others.[11] Given this litany of vaccine dangers, it is highly unlikely the vaccine was removed simply for ineffectiveness. Yet when has the CDC ever been truthful with the public?  The development and promotion of the influenza vaccine was never completely about protecting the public. It has been the least popular vaccine in the US including among healthcare workers. Instead, similar to the mumps vaccine in the MMR, it has been the cash cow for vaccine makers.  Determining the actual severity of any given flu season is burdened by federal intentional confusion to mislead the public.  The CDC’s first line of propaganda defense to enforce flu vaccinations is to exaggerate flu infections as the cause of preventable deaths.   However, validating this claim is near impossible because the CDC does not differentiate deaths caused by influenza infection and deaths due to pneumonia.  On its website, the CDC lumps flu and pneumonia deaths together, currently estimated at 55,227. The large majority of these were pneumonia deaths of elderly patients. Yet in any given year, only 3-18% of suspected influenza infections actually test positive for a Type A or B influenza strain.[12]  Dr. Martin Meltzer, a CDC expert in health economics, has stated “almost nobody dies of the flu” and “deaths [are] associated with flu, but not necessarily caused by flu.”[13]  To date there is only one gold standard clinical trial with the flu vaccine that compares vaccinated vs. unvaccinated, and it is not good news for the CDC and the vaccine makers. This Hong Kong funded double-blind placebo controlled study following the health conditions of vaccinated and unvaccinated children between the ages of 6-15 years for 272 days. The trial concluded the flu vaccine holds no health benefits. In fact, those vaccinated with the flu virus were observed to have a 550% higher risk of contracting non-flu virus respiratory infections. Among the vaccinated children, there were 116 flu cases compared to 88 among the unvaccinated; there were 487 other non-influenza virus infections, including rhinovirus, coxsackie, echovirus and others, among the vaccinated versus 88 with the unvaccinated.  This single study alone poses a scientifically sound warning and rationale for avoiding the vaccine.[14]  It is worth noting that there are approximately 200 distinct viruses that are misdiagnosed as influenza and produce flu-like symptoms. These organisms don’t magically appear during fall and winter – they are always with us. Nevertheless we are more susceptible to flu-like infections during the colder months when there are less daylight hours.  In a later study by Dr. Danuta Skowronski in Canada, individuals with a history of receiving consecutive seasonal flu shots over several years had an increased risk of becoming infected with H1N1 swine flu.  Skowronski commented on his findings that “policy makers have not yet had a chance to fully digest them [the study’s conclusions] or understand the implications.”  He continued, “Who knows, frankly? The wise man knows he knows nothing when it comes to influenza, so you always have to be cautious in speculating.”[15]  There is strong evidence suggesting that all vaccine clinical trials carried out by manufacturers fall short of demonstrating vaccine efficacy accurately. And when they are shown to be efficacious, it is frequently in the short term and offer only partial or temporary protection. According to an article in the peer-reviewed Journal of Infectious Diseases, the only way to evaluate vaccines is to scrutinize the epidemiological data obtained from real-life conditions. In other words, researchers simply cannot — or will not — adequately test a vaccine’s effectiveness and immunogenicity prior to its release onto an unsuspecting public.[16]  The Cochrane Collaboration, the world’s foremost group of unbiased researchers, physicians and scientists, has performed a series of meta-analyses on the effectiveness of the influenza vaccine. In 2014 they found that vaccinating adults against influenza did not affect the number of people hospitalized nor decrease lost work.[17]Cochrane researchers stated that their results might be overly optimistic due to the fact that 24 out of 90 studies were funded by the vaccine manufacturers, which tend to produce results favorable to their product.[18]  According to Dr. Tom Jefferson at the Cochrane Collaboration, it makes little sense to keep vaccinating against seasonal influenza based on the evidence.[19] Jefferson has also endorsed more cost-effective and scientifically-proven means of minimizing the transmission of flu, including regular hand washing and wearing masks. There is also substantial peer-reviewed literature supporting the supplementation of Vitamin D.  Dr. Jefferson’s conclusions are backed by a 2013 article by Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine scientist Peter Doshi, PhD, in the British Journal of Medicine. In his article Doshi questions the flu vaccine paradigm stating:  “Closer examination of influenza vaccine policies shows that although proponents employ the rhetoric of science, the studies underlying the policy are often of low quality, and do not substantiate officials’ claims. The vaccine might be less beneficial and less safe than has been claimed, and the threat of influenza appears overstated.”[20] The CDC currently recommends that elderly Americans receive a flu shot, stating that “[v]accination is especially important for people 65 years and older because they are at high risk for complications from flu.”[21]  Unfortunately, this warning is grossly unfounded. A significant body of research proves that receiving the flu shot does not reduce mortality among seniors.[22] One particularly compelling 2005 study was carried out by scientists at the federal National Institutes of Health (NIH) and published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA). Not only did the study indicate that the flu vaccine did nothing to prevent deaths from influenza among seniors, but that flu mortality rates increased as a greater percentage of seniors received the shot.[23]  After the release of the study, investigative journalist Sharyl Attkisson covered the findings in a CBS News segment. Attkisson interviewed the only co-author of the study who was not affiliated with the NIH, Dr. Tom Reichert, who stated that the research team revisited the data several times, but that no matter how they analyzed the “incendiary material”, the conclusion was clear: flu shots don’t improve mortality rates in the elderly population.[24]  Dr. Sherri Tenpenny viewed the Cochrane Database reviews on the flu vaccine’s efficacy. In a review of 51 studies involving over 294,000 children, there was “no evidence that injecting children 6-24 months of age with a flu shot was any more effective than placebo. In children over 2 years of age, flu vaccine effectiveness was 33 percent of the time preventing flu. In children with asthma, inactivated flu vaccine did not prevent influenza related hospitalizations in children. The database shows that children who received the flu vaccine were at a higher risk of hospitalization than children who did not receive the vaccine.[25]  In a separate study involving 400 children with asthma receiving a flu vaccine and 400 who were not immunized, there was no difference in the number of clinic and emergency room visits and hospitalizations between the two groups.[26] In 64 studies involving 66,000 adults, “Vaccination of healthy adults only reduced risk of influenza by 6 percent and reduced the number of missed work days by less than one day. There was change in the number of hospitalizations compared to the non-vaccinated. In further studies of elderly adults residing in nursing homes over the course of several flu seasons, flu vaccinations were insignificant for preventing infection.[27]  During every annual quarter, the CDC’s Advisory Commission on Childhood Vaccines meets, and the Department of Justice releases its report on settlements made for vaccine injuries and deaths. In recent years, the flu vaccine has topped the charts.  During its most recent release in June 2016, 85 of the 116 cases, and 2 of the 3 deaths, settled by the “vaccine court” over a three month period were associated with the flu vaccine.[28] While this might appear to be a small and insignificant number compared to the millions of vaccines administered, it bears noting that the CDC itself admits that only 10% of vaccine adverse effects go reported. Independent analysis indicates it may be as small as 1-2% at best.  For almost a decade, the CDC has known influenza vaccines are ineffective and life-threatening for the elderly but continues to market them without hesitation. Hence in November 2014, five senior citizens at an assisted living facility in Dacula, Georgia, died within week after all residents were vaccinated.[29] During the previous year’s flu vaccine trials, Sanofi Pasteur’s  Fluzone killed 23 elderly participants during the vaccine trial. Nevertheless, the vaccine was approved and continues to be marketed towards senior citizens.[30]  Today, the most extreme wing of the pro-vaccine community, headed by Paul Offit at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, have been diligently pursuing mandatory vaccination and encouraging states to repeal personal religious and philosophical exemption from vaccinating.  During the flu season, the debate over mandatory vaccination becomes most heated as medical facilities and government departments attempt to threaten employees and schools who refuse vaccination. Although this is deeply worrisome to those who advocate their Constitutional rights to freedom of choice in their healthcare, there are respectable groups opposing mandatory flu shots.  Among them are the American Medical Association and the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons.  According to the statement of the latter, the Association “objects strenuously to any coercion of healthcare personnel to receive influenza immunization. It is a fundamental human right not to be subjected to medical interventions without fully informed consent.”  The American Medical Association statement recognizes “philosophic reason” as a valid means for exemption.  In addition, many union organizations, such as National Nurses United, the American Federation of Teachers, and the Coalition of Kaiser Permanente Unions now oppose mandatory flu shots. What these organizations recognize and is categorically denied by the Paul Offits in the pro-vaccine cabal, is the hard science raising serious questions over the flu vaccine’s efficacy and safety that doesn’t justify a national mandate.  The good news is that Americans are rapidly losing confidence in the CDC. According to National Consumers League poll, over two-thirds of Americans believe vaccines cause autism, which the CDC categorically denies.[31] Almost two months after the media reported on the revelations by a CDC whistleblower, Dr. William Thompson, who exposed the CDC cover up of a vaccine-autism connection with the MMR vaccine, a CBS News poll showed public approval of the CDC nosedived to 37%, down from 60% the previous year. Vaccine apologists and the major media claim this large decrease is due to the CDC’s dismal handling of the Ebola crisis; however, Thompson’s whistleblowing received over 750 million Twitter impressions indicating that the debate over vaccine efficacy and safety is far more on the public’s mind.[32] Positive endorsement of the CDC would plummet further if the public knew the full extent of CDC officials lying to Congress and their conspiracy to commit medical fraud for over a dozen years.  Imagine the tens of thousands of children and families who would have been saved from life-long neurological damage and immeasurable suffering if the CDC was not indebted to protecting the toxic products of the pharmaceutical industry and was serving the health and well-being of American children? And we can begin to further dismantle this citadel of despotic medical fascism by simply refusing the flu vaccine and protecting ourselves by adopting a healthier lifestyle during the flu season.",MISINFORMED
BASIC FACTS TO KNOW ABOUT VACCINATION,http://www.vaclib.org/basic/basicfct.htm,"BASIC FACTS TO KNOW ABOUT VACCINATIONS *Vaccines contain substances poisonous to humans (i.e. mercury, formaldehyde, aluminum, etc.) Vaccine package inserts contain this and other information required by law to be disclosed to the public. Although these inserts are produced for consumers, doctors do not make them available to their patients. *Vaccines are grown on and contain foreign tissue and altered genetic material of both human and animal origin. 2. Immunization (the act of injecting vaccines) depresses and disables brain and immune function. Honest, unbiased scientific investigation has shown vaccinations to be a causative factor in many illnesses including: *Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (aka SIDS, crib or cot death) *developmental disorders (autism, seizures, mental retardation, hyperactivity, dyslexia, etc.) *immune deficiency (i.e. AIDS, Epstein Barre Syndrome, etc.) *degenerative disease (i.e. muscular dystrophy, multiple sclerosis, arthritis, cancer, leukemia, lupus, fibromyalgia, etc.) 3. The high rate of adverse vaccine reactions is being ignored and denied by conventional medicine. *Prior to 1990, doctors were not legally required to report adverse reactions to the Center for Disease Control (CDC). *Adverse reactions are considered ""normal"", are ignored or diagnosed as other diseases. Even with this poor system, reported damage is substantial. *Despite their current legal obligation, less than 10% of doctors report the damage they witness to the CDC. *Throughout history, many prominent medical and non-medical health professionals around the world have voiced their vehement opposition to vaccination calling it scientific fraud. 4. Mass Vaccination Programs systematically and recklessly endanger the public while disregarding our rights. *Since vaccination breaks the skin, it is technically a surgery. All surgeries by law require informed consent. Informed consent is rarely attained before vaccines are administered. *Doctors vaccinate the unwitting and uninformed. The vaccine manufacturers' package inserts which contain biased industry claims and the bare minimum required by law to reveal are not routinely made available to consumers so that they can make a more informed choice. *Double-talk and unethical enforcement such as threats, intimidation and coercion are used to ensure vaccination compliance. 5. There is no proof that vaccinations are safe or effective. *There are no control group studies. Authorities consider that ""to not vaccinate"" is unethical and have refused to study unvaccinated volunteers. If control studies were done according ' to honest science, vaccination would be outlawed. *Studies which have been done are not designed to eliminate the examiners bias. Authorities who compile and report disease statistics work closely with and have a vested interest in companies which produce the vaccines. In other industries, this kind of bias is not tolerated. Injuries and deaths in these studies are attributed to anything but vaccination to skew the results and make it appear that vaccines have some merit. 6. Laws allow drug companies to violate the public trust. *In private vaccine damage suits, information is revealed condemning vaccines as deadly. *Vaccine manufacturers use ""gag orders"" as a leverage tool in vaccine damage legal settlements to restrict the plaintiff from disclosing to the public the truth about the dangerous nature of vaccines. Our government has allowed these unethical tactics to be used which jeopardize public welfare. 7. The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1987 is a pacifier. *This compensation program pretends to acknowledge the existence of vaccine damage by making ""right"" the wrongs done. Nothing in this Act attempts to avert these adverse events from happening in the future. *This Act is the result of vaccine producers pressuring the government to ""immunize"" them from private lawsuits which can run an average of $4 million per case. *The fund is made up of tax added into the cost to the consumer of each vaccine, thereby making vaccine consumers pay for one another's and perhaps their own injury; the vaccine manufacturers have made themselves quite ""immune"" from accountability. In recent years it has become even more difficult to be compensated through this program due to the parameters for determining vaccine damage changing and coroners now ruling out vaccine damage and charging the parents with Shaken Baby Syndrome. 8. Private insurance companies, which do the best liability studies, have totally abandoned coverage for damage to life and property due to: *It is claimed that vaccines avert a possible future risk and yet people are pressured to decide on the spot. A doctor's use of fear and intimidation to force compliance is not ethical. Vaccines are drugs with potential serious adverse reactions. Time and forethought should be given before a decision is made. 10. There is no law enforcing vaccination for babies or anyone else. *Vaccination is linked with school attendance but is not compulsory. Exemptions from vaccinations, although restricted and monitored, are part of every state public health law and can be expanded by public pressure. *Departments of Health, Education and the American Medical Association personnel profit from the sale of vaccines. They keep the existence of and details about exemptions relatively unknown. For more information or to obtain a $30 membership packet which documents the facts in this flyer, contact:",MISINFORMED
11 toxic disease causing ingredients in vaccines,http://www.naturalhealth365.com/vaccines-thimerosal-1649.html,"(NaturalHealth365) Wherever they turn, parents are bombarded with demands that they vaccinate their children. From public schools to the trusted pediatrician, the message is loud and clear that vaccines are a critical part of raising a healthy child. But, to protect our kids, we really need to wake up!Proponents would have us believe that vaccination is the only way to avoid the risk of deadly diseases. A similar message urges adults to get the flu vaccine each fall, despite a lack of evidence that it works. Of course, parents unwilling to get aboard the vaccination wagon run the risk of finding themselves demonized in the press, the physicians office and the public eye.What they know in their gut is not always reflective of the action they take. Most parents have probably heard about at least some of the dangerous ingredients used in vaccines. Yet the wide majority will end up bowing to pressure anyway, subjecting their young children to health risks much greater than the risk of disease they are vaccinating against.There is ample reason to avoid vaccinations. Here is a list of some of the most deadly ingredients used in vaccines as well as the health risk they pose:1. Acetone: This clear, volatile liquid is used as a paint solvent and nail polish remover. It is also well known as an industrial chemical used in plastics and manufacturing.2. Aluminum phosphate and aluminum sulfate: Known also by its chemical make up, phosphoric acid and aluminum salt, aluminum phosphate consists of a corrosive acid and neurotoxin. Similarly, aluminum sulfate is known by its components, sulfuric acid, an extremely carcinogenic and corrosive acid, and aluminum salt, a neurotoxin.3. Benzethonium chloride: This dangerous chemical is a known carcinogen. It is also known to cause genetic mutations in unborn children.4. Ethanol: Also known as ethyl alcohol, ethanol is known to cause vomiting, headaches, drowsiness and uncounsciousness.5. Formaldehyde: This is an extremely dangerous carcinogen, as well as a source of genetic mutation in the unborn.6. Glutaraldehyde: This liquid chemical has a number of industrial uses, including use as a disinfectant, preservative, biocide, hardening agent, preservative, and embalming agent. It is known to cause asthma, allergies, breathing problems, and coughing.7. Human serum albumin: A human protein, but it can only be broken down when digested. When it is injected it can cause autoimmune encephalitis (AE) disorders and allergies.8. Animal components: Vaccines contain both monkey cells, which carry viruses that can cause cancer and diseases, as well as baby cow blood after the red blood cells have been removed. The latter, known as calf serum, can be extremely contaminated with viruses and bacteria.9. Polysorbate 80: This chemical is an emulsifier and a surfactant known to cause infertility. Polysorbate 80 is also known to increase the risk of stroke and heart attack.10. Phenol-carbolic acid: This corrosive acid has been identified by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as an extremely hazardous substance. The CDC itself recommends avoiding all contact. The chemical is known to cause a host of symptoms, from nausea, vomiting and dizziness to the more serious symptoms of convulsions, coma and even death.11. Thimerosal: Also known as ethylmercury, thimerosal is 49.6 percent mercury, the second most toxic element on earth next to plutonium. And, yes, this too is a known neurotoxin.Editors note: The Vaccine World Summit is the worlds first FREE online summit dedicated to vaccine safety news, infectious disease solutions and the latest advances in immune protective protocols.

10 Reasons Not to Vaccinate,https://vactruth.com/2014/12/12/10-reasons-not-to-vaccinate/,"The decision to vaccinate is yours alone, but it is a decision that should not be taken lightly or done under duress or pressure by others. Once vaccinated, the potential side-effects cannot be easily undone, if at all. These include death, sudden infant death syndrome, auto-immune disorders, inflammatory bowel disease, allergies, asthma, ADHD, autism, Guillian-Barr Syndrome and other neurological damage.Your physician will most likely NOT connect the development of these unnatural disease states with vaccination, whether they occur immediately after vaccinations, several days or months later. You alone will be responsible for treating your child or yourself for these life-long diseases.The decision to vaccinate SHOULD include extensive research to determine if it is right for your family.The following are ten reasons not to vaccinate. Additional educational resources follow.1. Vaccines have never been proven safe or effective. Vaccine studies funded by pharmaceutical companies compare vaccine side-effects from one vaccine to another. True, scientific, double-blind placebo studies have never been conducted on vaccines to determine their safety. Effectiveness cannot be determined unless one is then knowingly exposed to the disease entity following vaccination. Only antibody production is measured. See How Pharmaceutical Companies Hide the Dangers of Vaccines from Parents.2. Vaccines do NOT work. They may create a temporary increase in antibodies for a particular disease, but this does not equate to immunity to disease. Vaccines, with all of their toxins and their unnatural way of introducing disease directly into ones blood stream, decrease cellular immunity, which is more critical for ones immune system. Neurologist Russell Blaylock has lectured and written extensively on this subject.When there are outbreaks of disease, unvaccinated children are often blamed. Whenever the outbreaks are examined more closely, the data show that the majority of those suffering have been vaccinated for the disease.Disease charts show that diseases were mostly eliminated prior to the creation of vaccinations. What is truly responsible for most communicable disease elimination is clean water and improved sanitation. See the following graphs: Disease Graphs Showing Decline of Childhood Illnesses Prior to Vaccines.3. The very first vaccine was a disaster. Vaccine safety and effectiveness is a created myth, strongly embedded in Americans psyche and reinforced by the health care system.The history of small pox vaccines demonstrates that the first vaccine resulted in an increase in the disease and created additional serious health consequences including syphilis and deaths. Physician groups met repeatedly to discuss the vaccine problem and concluded that as long as vaccines remained profitable, they would be impossible to eliminate, in spite of the evidence against them. Nothing has changed since this time.The polio vaccine was another one linked to serious health consequences, including cancer and AIDS. Statistics were manipulated to try and prove this vaccines effectiveness. With each new vaccine has come new health damage and created illness. See Small Pox Vaccine: Origins of Vaccine Madness.4. Vaccines are highly profitable for pharmaceutical companies and the health care industry. Strong financial incentives exist to continue this practice, not effectiveness. You cannot trust brochures on vaccines provided by pharmaceutical companies because they are corporations with a profit motive. Their objective is NOT to protect health but to sell vaccines.5. All vaccines contain a number of toxic poisons and chemicals that are linked to serious neurological damage including aluminum, thimerosal (methyl mercury), antibiotics, monosodium glutamate (MSG) and formaldehyde. Other dangerous substances found in vaccines include antifreeze, lead, cadmium, glycerine, acetone, and yeast proteins.6. Every study comparing unvaccinated to vaccinated children demonstrates that unvaccinated children enjoy far superior health. Unvaccinated children generally do not suffer from upper respiratory illnesses, ear infections, autism, ADHD, asthma, allergies, auto-immune disorders and other diseases, in comparison to those vaccinated. (See Sally Fallon Morells The Nourishing Traditions Book of Baby and Child Care, 2013.)7. Vaccines cause a host of chronic, incurable, and life threatening diseases, including autism, asthma, ADHD, auto-immune disorders, Guillain-Barre Syndrome, food allergies and brain damage. [1]8. The only way to create true life-long immunity to a disease is through natural exposure to the disease in which the body creates true antibodies and immunity on many levels.9. Vaccines kill infants, children and adults. Strong evidence links vaccines to sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). [2] More than one hundred previously healthy young women have died as a result of the HPV vaccine. [3] The flu vaccine has been documented as awarding the most money for serious health injuries, including death. [4] [5]The long term effects of vaccines are unknown. It is a medical experiment of ones health for which no one knows the long term health consequences.US children are given far more vaccines at younger ages compared to other countries. Infant mortality rates for US children are one of the worst in the world, especially compared to countries who vaccinate their children less and who have wisely raised vaccination ages. [6]10. If you or a loved one suffers from a vaccine injury, pharmaceutical companies and physicians hold no medical liability. In 1986, the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act was formed, eliminating the ability to directly sue pharmaceutical companies or health care practitioners responsible for vaccine injuries.You are on your own to try and regain your health in the event that you are vaccine injured. The expense and suffering is yours alone to face. Very few individuals will be awarded money from funds set up by the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act. The system is designed for individuals to fail in making their claim of vaccine injury. The public pays for this injury fund in the cost of taxes on vaccinations.To learn more, read my other in-depth articles on vaccinations which have been published on VacTruth or Natural News, here: VaccinationsYou may also check the resources below.

The shocking ingredients in flu vaccines,http://www.naturalnews.com/056004_vaccines_toxins_toxic_ingredients.html,"(NaturalNews) The push for widespread flu vaccination is something that happens year after year. In fact, it seems as though the mainstream medical community is becoming even more demanding and aggressive about their vaccination agenda than ever before. Just this past September, the CDC updated their flu vaccination guidelines so they could encourage people with egg allergies to get the flu vaccine. As many people are aware, in the past having an egg allergy exempted you from having to get the vaccine because this particular shot contains traces of eggs. Seems perfectly reasonable and logical, doesn't it? Well, they're throwing logic out the window with their new suggestions. People with minor allergic reactions, like hives, are called upon to be vaccinated as usual, at any location of their choosing. For those with more severe reactions – like anaphylactic shock, which can kill you – it is suggested that they get vaccinated at their doctor's office, a hospital or other medical facility. That way, when the person's throat closes up, hopefully someone will be able to save their life. That seems perfectly reasonable to ask someone to do, don't you think? Apparently having a life-threatening food allergy is no longer enough to allow people to be remiss in their civic duty to be injected with harmful substances. To be perfectly honest, for the average non-allergic person, eggs in the flu vaccine are really the least worrisome ingredient. There are things in vaccines many times more toxic than egg whites could ever hope to be. Mercury, for example, is a toxic heavy metal. Despite industry claims that mercury is not used in vaccines, it still seems to have quite the presence. In 2014, Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, revealed that laboratory testing showed quite a different story about the mercury content in flu shots. Using ICP-MS technology, Adams found that Fluval – a common flu shot – contained mercury at a level of 51 parts per million. The Health Ranger notes that this volume of mercury is more than 25,000 times higher than the maximum contaminant level of inorganic mercury allowed in drinking water, as per the standards set by the EPA. Adams writes, ""In fact, the concentration of mercury found in this GSK flu shot was 100 times higher than the highest level of mercury we've ever tested in contaminated fish."" Sodium deoxycholate is another concerning ingredient that is also featured in many flu vaccines. This chemical is actually a water-soluble ionic detergent and bile salt, and it is also known to promote cell death. Sodium deoxycholate has been shown to weaken the blood-brain barrier, and subsequently lead to seizures. It's thought that the chemical can also induce DNA damage. Synergistic toxicity has also been seen when combined with certain medications. Researchers from the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine found that the toxicity of sodium deoxycholate created an inflammatory response that persisted for 10 days following exposure. Neomycin sulfate and polymyxin B are two antibiotic agents that are often featured in flu vaccines. Supposedly, these antibiotics are added to vaccines during manufacturing to prevent bacterial contamination. One would hope that the conditions under which an injected substance is created would be clean and sterile enough not to warrant the addition of antibiotics for ""safety,"" but apparently that may not be the case. Furthermore, given the growing concerns over antibiotic resistance in humans, it stands to reason that injecting antibiotics into uninfected individuals is probably not the best idea. There are, of course, many other toxic aspects to flu vaccines. Some have alleged, for example that glyphosate, the primary ingredient in Roundup, may be present in a number of vaccines. Vaccines are not what the mainstream medical world wants you to believe; they are filled with harmful chemicals that no person would willingly inject into their body. The prevalence of pro-vaccine science truly showcases the increasing need for independent science.

Vaccines Cause Autism,http://www.ageofautism.com/2014/08/vaccines-cause-autism.html,"Vaccines cause autism. Or, is it vaccines result in autism?You say tomato. I say to-mah-to.Cause it. Result in it. Vaccines did it. You know it. I know it. And now, come to find out, our government apparently knew it too.For years now more than enough people have suggested that vaccines cause autism. Several have tried to prove it. Try as they might, those who should have acknowledged it have turned a blind eye. Not only did they do that, but they adamantly defended themselves with skewed statistics. News of these skewed statistics came from someone working at the CDC. The CDCs slogan is Saving Lives. Protecting People. After last weeks news I cant help but ask whose lives were they trying to save? Their own? Whose lives were they protecting? Themselves?Relying on paperwork instead of listening to those whove been negatively affected by vaccines has kept officials heads in the clouds. Having their heads in the clouds gives them a free pass. It looks like that free pass was used by several people. According to the whistleblower, they didnt factually report their findings. They didnt accurately inform the public. They didnt reveal dangers associated with vaccines. They didnt publicly state the truth. That vaccines come with risks. That theyre loaded with side effects. That they dont offer lifelong immunity. And that they cause autism.Mind you that none of this information is new; its just kept so hush hush that unless you or a loved one has experienced a vaccine injury, it goes under the radar. Only when vaccine injury hits close to home is one forced to go back, read the fine print and put two and two together. Unfortunately, at that point, theyre left to fend for themselves. When vaccines cause autism, a vaccine injured is left high and dry. Thats because the vaccines industry is protected by the government, the same government that evidently knew that vaccines cause autism. Rather than looking out for and protecting the ones theyre meant to serve, the vaccine industry and those who oversee it have chosen to protect each other.",MISINFORMED
