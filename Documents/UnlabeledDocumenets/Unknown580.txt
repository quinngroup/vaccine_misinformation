The MMR vaccination is an immunization that many children receive at one year of age and protects against measles, mumps, and rubella. However, the vaccination can cause a number of side-effects that can have mild to rarely severe implications for your health. However, the risks of not getting the vaccine greatly outweigh the risks of the vaccine. If your child is about to receive the vaccine, or if you are an adult receiving the shot for the first time, understanding these complications and how to treat them can help you and your loved ones stay healthy.
