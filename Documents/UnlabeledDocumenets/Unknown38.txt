Eric Fombonne is worried, to say the least, about what a potential vaccine-safety commission headed by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. could mean for science and public safety.Putting Kennedy who has spent years pushing the link between vaccines and autism in such a position "shows a complete misunderstanding of science," said Fombonne, who researches autism epidemiology and vaccines."There is no link between [autism and vaccines] and a lot of time and public funding has been going to debunking those hypotheses," Fombonne said Thursday during a visit to Salt Lake City.The researcher was in Utah to speak at the University of Utah's Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute as well as the Carmen B. Pingree Autism Center for Learning about his current genetic research on autism.
