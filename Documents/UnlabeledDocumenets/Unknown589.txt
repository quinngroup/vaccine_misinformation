Dr Hilary appeared on Lorraine this morning to plead with people who are offered the flu jab to take the vaccine - even if they are worried about the symptoms of flu.Sharon, a caller, asked the doctor if she should be having the jab.Hilary, 63, told Sharon if she'd been offered the jab she had been offered the jab by her doctor then she should definitely take it.He said: "Of course you should have that flu jab."It's one of the safest jabs around- why wouldn't you? It's safe, it's effective and it's going to cost you nothing."
