A vaccine insert available via the US Food and Drug Administration website lists autism as one of many reported severe adverse side effects.Sanofi Pasteurs whooping cough vaccine Tripedia, which was designed to be administered in five doses between six weeks and seven years of age, is no longer available on the market, but the serums insert last updated in December 2005 provides hints to why it may have been pulled.Under a section on page 11 describing ADVERSE REACTIONS, researchers acknowledged autism, among other serious complications, had been reported following the vaccines administration.Other events reported to have been triggered by the vaccine included idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (low levels of blood platelets), SIDS (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome), anaphylactic reaction (severe allergic reaction), cellulitis (bacterial skin infection), convulsion/grand mal convulsion, encephalopathy (brain inflammation), hypotonia (floppy baby syndrome), neuropathy (pain due to nerve damage), somnolence (extreme drowsiness) and apnea (suspension of breathing during sleep).The document goes on to state that Events were included in this list because of the seriousness or frequency of reporting, but an added caveat distances researchers and its product from liability:Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequencies or to establish a causal relationship to components of Tripedia vaccine.The Tripiedia DTaP vaccine approved in 1996, which contained a trace amount of thimerosal, aluminum, gelatin, polysorbate 80 and formaldehyde, was evidently much better than its predecessor.DTaP replaced an older, very reactive whole cell pertussis vaccine DPT that was associated with more cases of high fever, collapse/shock, convulsions, brain inflammation and permanent brain damage, said Barbara Loe Fisher, the mother of a child injured by the DPT vaccine, on behalf of the non-profit National Vaccine Information Center.Over half of the 2,480 awards for vaccine injury and death, totaling $2 billion, made under the 1986 National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act, involved Pertussis vaccine.Meanwhile, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention maintains an entire page dedicated to claims there is no causal link between vaccines and autism.See the archived vaccine insert below:
