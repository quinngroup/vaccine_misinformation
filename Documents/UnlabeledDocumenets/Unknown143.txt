Although it is ore likely for a young animal to have a reaction during their series of vaccinations, any ANIMAL AT any AGE can have a reaction.Vaccines are important to protect your pet against various diseases such as Canine Distemper, Hepatitis, Leptospirosis, Parvo, Parainfluenza, Corona, Bordatella, Lyme Disease, Feline Rhinotracheitis, Calici virus, Panleukopenia, Chlamydia, Leukemia, Ferret Distemper and Rabies. These diseases are still present in the population and can cause life-threatening diseases.Any time a vaccine is given it stimulate the immune system to form antibodies against disease. In some animals, the immune system can over-respond and have atypical reactions/presentation. These are listed below:Lethargy, fever, vomiting, diarrhea, soreness, anorexia, hair discoloration or loss at injection site, skin discoloration/scarring at injection site, fibrous reactive tissue (lump) at injection site, facial swelling/edema, pruritis (itching), auto-immune disease, cancerous tumors at injection site noted in cats, anaphylactic shock, or death.It depends on the severity. Most pets are treated with an antihistamine and/or steroid, to negate the over responsive immune system. These may be giving as injections and/or as medications to go home. If severe, other treatments or medications may be administered. After the reaction, you should discuss further vaccination with the veterinarian in regards to a revised vaccination schedule or a letter or waiver, to allow your pet to not be vaccinated.
