Our mission is to accelerate equitable and sustainable access to vaccines through the generation, synthesis and use of evidence to inform decision making and action. IVAC aims to build knowledge and support for the value of vaccines and strong immunization programs to ensure they reach those who would benefit most. Everything we do is through a lens of rigorous science, clear communication, and productive partnership.
