By Washington State law, pregnant women and kids under three areunable to get vaccines that contain more than trace amounts of mercury (thimerosal). The Secretary of the Washington State Department of Health may suspend the states law to protect the publics health against disease if there is a vaccine shortage or outbreak.In October 2010, the Secretary of Health declared a shortage of mercury-free flu vaccine for pregnant women and kids under three with latex allergies. This declaration temporarily suspended our states limit on mercury in certain flu vaccines. This was due to the Food and Drug Administration finding that certain mercury-free flu vaccines may contain trace amounts of latex. Without access to another vaccine, pregnant women or kids under three with a latex allergy had limited or no access to flu vaccine.The same issue remained for the 2011-2012 and 2012-2013 flu seasons. The Secretary of Health temporarily extended the suspension during those seasons.The most recent suspension expired on June 30, 2013. It will not be extended for the 2013-2014 season. Vaccine supply has changed. Other mercury-free, latex-free flu vaccines are now available.Please use the following chart to see which mercury-free flu vaccines are appropriate for pregnant women and kids under three with a risk of latex allergy.* FluMist is not licensed for pregnant women.
