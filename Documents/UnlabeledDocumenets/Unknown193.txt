Now heres a kicker. The shingles vaccine contains live, weakened [attenuated] varicella zoster virus. It is 14 times as potent as the chicken pox vaccine. Putting this potency into a more aged body that may have less defenses doesnt make sense to me.Ive heard of elderly people getting shingles after having the vaccine. It isnt fail safe and doesnt reduce the risk of lingering pain if shingles does erupt. Since all vaccines are suspect until theyve been monitored for decades for long term dangers, this new vaccine is only 50% effective.It is not suggested for people with medical conditions suppressing their immune systems such as organ transplant patients. The vaccine is also the most expensive at 200.00. Merck is the manufacturer and has the ingredients listed as:31.16mg of sucrose [this is sugar]0.62mg of MSG [monosodium glutamate a meat tenderizer suspected to cause toxic headaches]Residual components of MRC 5 cell including DNA and protein, trace quantities of neomycin and bovine calf serum [MRC-5 is derived from lung tissue of a 14 week old fetus] [Neomycin is an antibiotic]Do you want to put these ingredients into your healthy body?
