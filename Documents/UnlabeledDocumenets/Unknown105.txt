Vaccine Information Statements (VIS) are information sheets produced by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that explain both the benefits and risks of a vaccine to vaccine recipients, their parents, or their legal representatives. Federal law requires that VIS be handed out whenever certain vaccinations are given.In Michigan, it isimportant thatvaccine recipients, their parents, or their legal representatives be given the Michigan versions of VIS because they include information about MCIR. By state law in Michigan, patients must be informed about MCIR. Vaccine Information Statementsthat are obtained from other sources (e.g., from the CDC or IAC websites) do not contain information about MCIR.
