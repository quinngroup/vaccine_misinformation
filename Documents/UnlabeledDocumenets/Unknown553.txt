Treating acute/chronic side effects caused by vaccinations in dogs and catsMild vaccination reactions in pets such as fever, swelling, and soreness may be treated at home with a short course of an antihistamine such as Diphenhydramine (Generic Benadryl) and/or a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) such as Excel Aspirin. More severe acute health or life-threatening reactions may require veterinary hospitalization, as well as stabilization with IV fluids and injectable Benadryl, Atropine, steroids, and epinephrine. Most acute vaccine reactions usually respond quite rapidly to treatment, with clinical symptoms resolving within 24 to 48 hours. Chronic reactions to vaccination are much more difficult to treat, especially in cases of organ failure, chronic digestive tract disorders, behavioral problems, neurological reactions, and hormonal dysfunction.The mental, emotional, and physical symptoms that develop in pets as a result of chronic reaction to vaccination is known as vaccinosis. Conventional medicine may palliate or suppress these symptoms, but often the best chance at a cure is by consulting with a homeopathic veterinarian, who can prescribe carefully selected, single-homeopathic remedies evaluated over time. Holistic veterinarians are also much more likely not to use a one-size-fits-all vaccination program, and will offer other options, including measuring vaccination titers instead of vaccination, or the use of homeopathic nosodes.
