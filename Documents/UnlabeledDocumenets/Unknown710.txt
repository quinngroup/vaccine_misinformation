The Value of Investing in Vaccines The International Vaccine Access Center at Johns Hopkins, with support from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, has undertaken research into the economic benefits of immunization. These analyses have shown that immunization can have a powerful impact on economies from the global level down to the family level, and gives many more children the opportunity to reach their fifth birthday safe and sound. Beyond preventing more than 100 million cases of illness and averting 3.7 million deaths in young children over the next ten years, immunizing children with three crucial vaccines against pneumonia, diarrhea and meningitis would hold major economic benefits for both families and governments. Rolling out childhood immunizations against Hib, pneumococcal and rotavirus diseases in the worlds 73 poorest countries over the next decade would result in an estimated $63 billion in treatment and productivity savings. Averting short-term costs of disease treatment saves $1.4 billion and avoiding the lost wages of caretakers saves $313 million, while averting the long term economic costs of lost productivity due to disability and death may add savings of $61 billion to these economies in the long term. The ability to avert 3.7 million deaths by using pneumococcal, Hib and rotavirus vaccines has an estimated value of $115 billion for those in at-risk countries.
