Laura Dye was all for childhood vaccinations until she had her first child. Then she got cold feet after reading what she now calls scare mongering online."I was super scared about vaccines," says Dye, who lives in southern Delaware. "It was my new little baby. He was so perfect."She wanted to limit vaccines out of concern they might harm her newborn son. Her husband, Jared, wanted their new son fully vaccinated. He had a great aunt who had polio and said that is never happening to our kid, Dye says.It was the vaccine debate in a nutshell, with each parent pushing for what they thought was best for their baby.They compromised. They would space apart their babys shots so he got no more than 2 per checkup. It would take much longer to get him vaccinated than the CDC recommends.At the time, Dye was on board. But in less than 3 years, she had completely changed her mind. What happened?
