Todd W. initially created Harpocrates Speaks to provide a place for people to leave comments that have been censored at the Age of Autism blog. Since then, he has revamped the site to cover a range of topics: censorship, children's health, ethics, medicine, science and skepticism. Todd has studied the regulation of medical products (drugs, devices and biologics) and has volunteered on an institutional review board, providing ethical review of human subjects research.Todd is not a physician or formal scientist. His statements on this blog should therefore not be taken as medical advice (get that from your doctor) nor as definitive scientific proof (go to the consensus of scientific literature for that).Follow me on Twitter (Tweek75) or e-mail me at todd [at] harpocratesspeaks [dot] comYou can also subscribe to Harpocrates Speaks for automatic updates.
