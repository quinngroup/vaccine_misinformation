HPV vaccines, long endorsed and promoted by the government, have an extended history of controversy because of their sometimes fatal side effects. Only two years ago, government officials in Japan withdrew their recommendation regarding the vaccines because of 2,000 reports of adverse effects.The U.S. government, meanwhile, has paid out millions of dollars to victims or families of victims.Now theres a whole new allegation, described by one observer as a game-changer, facing makers of the handful of vaccines that are used against a precursor to cervical cancer.Its from Dr. Sin Hang Lee, director of the Milford Molecular Diagnostics Laboratory of Milford, Connecticut, who alleges in an open-letter complaint to the head of the World Health Organization that top physicians engaged in gross misconduct, malfeasance and potentially criminal behavior to mislead the global public regarding the safety of HPV vaccines Gardasil and Cervarix.His letter to Dr. Margaret Chan, chief of the WHO, expresses grave concerns regarding statements by members of the Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety, the WHO, the Centers for Disease Control and others in a 2014 public hearing on HPV vaccine safety in Tokyo.I have come into possession of documentation which leads me to believe multiple individuals and organizations deliberately set out to mislead Japanese authorities regarding the safety of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines, Gardasil and Cervarix.He asks for her to act quickly and decisively on the issue.What he reportedly uncovered, according to an analysis from the Weston A. Price Foundation, which is critical of the vaccines, was that certain chemicals in the vaccines have been demonstrated to trigger the release of cytokines or proteins called tumor necrosis factors (TNF) in the body.Heres the help youll need to prepare your household for the realities of living under a centralized health-care system order Dr. Lee Hiebs Surviving the Medical Meltdown: Your Guide to Living Through the Disaster of ObamacareTNF cytokines can cause cell death, the foundation said. The release of TNF can also result in a wide range of reactions such as tumor regressions, septic shock (serious whole-body inflammatory response that can result in dangerously low blood pressure and death), and cachexia (a wasting syndrome where the body loses weight, becomes fatigued, and muscles atrophy).The details were gleaned from emails exchanged among several officials, Lee said.The chain of emails shows what appears to be a trail of attempts to conceal the truth, cover up the dangers, and generally mislead the public about what is and is not known about HPV vaccines and the dangers inherent to them, said Leslie Manookian, a spokesman for the foundation.The foundation explained Lees letter details communications between health officials from the U.S., Canada, Japan and the WHO, which demonstrate that these officials knew that HPV vaccines cause an inflammatory reaction greater than other vaccines, yet reassured the public in official hearings and statements that the vaccines were safe.Lee said the emails show officials worried about statements that HPV vaccine does not include an increase in inflammatory factors because such claim contradicted the data presented by another expert at their previous meeting which in fact confirmed that cytokines following vaccines increased particularly at injection site.Official statements deliberately mislead the public about what is known of the dangers of the contaminants discovered in the HPV vaccines as well as the bodily responses to these ingredients. Official statements appear to be a deliberate attempt to confuse the public into believing the safety concerns have been addressed in the peer-reviewed, published scientific literature when this is not the case, he said.The open letter, alleging what amounts to crimes against humanity if they are proven true, is a wake-up call to officials around the world. An immediate investigation must commence, and all HPV vaccines must be withdrawn from the market immediately, said Sally Fallon Morell, WAPF president.It is my opinion that those whose names [that] appeared in the emails attached to this complaint and all who blindly dismiss the potential toxicity of the newly created HPV L1 gene DNA/AAHS compound in order to continue to promote HPV vaccinations should be held accountable for their actions. There is no excuse for intentionally ignoring the scientific evidence. There is no excuse for misleading global vaccination policy makers at the expense of public interest, Lee wrote.Immediately, independent and thorough investigations into their actions with appropriate disciplinary action is the only option available that might restore the publics confidence in worldwide health authorities, he finished.WHO officials did not respond to a WND request for comment.WND has reported on the controversy over HPV vaccines for nearly a decade.The report about Japans backlash against HPV came from Judicial Watch, the Washington-based corruption watchdog that has been monitoring the effects of the drugs use in the U.S. for years.Not only does the Obama administration continue recommending Gardasil, it spends large sums of taxpayer dollars promoting it and works hard to keep details involving its dangers secret, Judicial Watch has charged.Multiple reports uncovered and cited by Judicial Watch discuss the dangers including death that the drug presents to children who are given the injections, which cost $600 per patient.Other side effects have included seizures, blindness, paralysis, speech problems, pancreatitis and short-term memory loss.Incredibly, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) fast-tracked Gardasils approval and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends it for girls starting at age 9, Judicial Watch said.The organization, which started investigating in 2007, has had to sue for the records in the face of Obama administration stonewalling.WND reported a Judicial Watch investigation found the government paid almost $6 million to victims of the shot, which covered only about one-fourth of the claims.WND also reported the federal government has recommended the HPV vaccination for girls and boys as young as 11.The organization explained it became interested in Gardasil when the drug was offered as a treatment for certain strains of cervical cancer caused by HPV. Judicial Watch said it discovered an atrocity from the profitable vaccine manufactured by pharmaceutical giant Merck.The reality is that droves of government records uncovered by Judicial Watch show that Gardasil has been linked to thousands of adverse reactions and debilitating side effects that the government wants to keep secret, the new report said. They include seizures, blindness, paralysis, speech problems, pancreatitis, short-term memory loss and dozens of deaths.Heres the help youll need to prepare your household for the realities of living under a centralized health-care system order Dr. Lee Hiebs Surviving the Medical Meltdown: Your Guide to Living Through the Disaster of Obamacare
