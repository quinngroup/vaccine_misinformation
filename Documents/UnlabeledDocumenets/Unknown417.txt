Our pipeline of potential new vaccines covers many of the diseases still having a serious impact around the world, including malaria, HIV, TB and Ebola.Our acquisition of Novartis' Vaccines business (excluding influenza vaccines) in early 2015 significantly expanded the number of vaccines we produce (now around 39), as well as the number of new vaccines we have in development (15), giving us the broadest portfolio of any vaccines company in the world.In 2015, the business contributed 3.7 billion (15%) to the overall turnover of the Group.Vaccination is recognised worldwide as one of the best investments that any government or healthcare organisation can make. In 2012, the WHO and its 194 members states published an action plan on vaccination to extend access to immunization to everyone in the world, promote innovation in the vaccines industry and prevent millions of deaths.This plan involves more equitable access to existing vaccines for people in all communities, the introduction of new and improved vaccines and accelerated research and development for the next generation of vaccines and technologies. Overall, this should translate into a growing global demand for vaccines over the next 10-15 years.For example, more than 25 million children are born every year in India alone and its estimated that by 2020 there will be more than a billion people in the world aged over 60. To meet this demand, its crucial that we have a long-term sustainable business.
