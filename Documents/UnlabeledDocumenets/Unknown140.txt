This page contains too many unsourced statements, and needs to be improved. Vaccination Information Network could use some help. Please research the article's assertions. Whatever is credible should be sourced, and what is not should be removed."I started the Vaccination Information Network (VINE) in 1988 and the VINE Facebook page in 2009, to help parents make an informed choice on behalf of their children. Please note that VINE is not a forum for debate.Typical crap on their/his page reads "by far the most common letter or post sent into us , is the latest pro vax article going viral.... with people asking for a rebuttal...... the current one is 'dear parents, you are being lied to...'"I wasn't the only one on the page to suggest that parents "choosing" not to vaccinate might become murderers if their unprotected sick child then infects a child too young to be vaccinated.
