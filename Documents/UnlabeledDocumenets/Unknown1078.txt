Question: Dear Dr. Dodds, Tuesday and I are spending a lot of time in the desert and I am concerned about snake bites here, as springnears. I have seen a snake vaccine offered in the area. What do you think about it? Thanks!Dr. Dodds Says: The rattlesnake vaccine is a killed, inactivated product that Ive been told will not protect against the Mojave Green, the most common form of rattlesnake in the Southern California desert. As it is not a highly purified snake extract, it does cause adverse reactions, some quite serious with sloughing of skin and muscle at and below the injection site. Boosters are required after the initial series on a annual basis. We recommend teaching your animals rattlesnake avoidance. Best wishes, Dr. Jean Dodds
