Dr. Meredith Wadman, author of The Vaccine Race: Science, Politics, and the Human Costs of Defeating Disease takes on the anti-vaccine movement. Pat Thurston and Dr. Wadman discuss why and how vaccines were developed in the first place and why not vaccinating children is extremely dangerous to the rest of society.Pat: Is there anything valid about the panic about the preservative thimerosal in vaccines because it contains mercury?Meredith: The type of mercury used in the vaccines up until about the turn of the century was ethel mercury. It is a different formulation and it is quickly excreted from the body. It does not cause problems. Because of the fears out there it was removed anyway and autism ratesPat: And the doctor who put that out there was discredited, disgraced and he lost his license.Meredith: Precisely, when thimerosal was removed from vaccines, autism rates continued to rise. Im not disputing that there is something in the environment that may be causing autism, but I tell you weve looked under the vaccine rock and theres nothing there.
