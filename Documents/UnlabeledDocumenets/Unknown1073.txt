Should your teenager get the relatively new meningitis B vaccine?With meningitis outbreaks at several universities that have proved deadly in recent years, including the 2014 death of a San Diego State University student, the answer might seem clear.But experts said the decision-making is complicated because a childs chance of suffering this bacterial infection is infinitesimal while the efficacy and safety track record for both approved versions of the vaccine is limited.With students off from school for Thanksgiving and then again for the Christmas winter break, family doctors and pediatricians will likely see an increased load of patients seeking physicals, vaccinations and other preventive care. Experts said many of those patients may have seen or heard vaccine companies marketing messages about getting adolescents and teens vaccinated under new guidelines from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Dr. Mark Sawyer, an infectious disease specialist at Rady Childrens Hospital San Diego who has helped set national vaccination policy, said the meningitis decision is more nuanced than it is for more routine vaccinations that have been around for decades.Physicians are struggling with this because we do not have a precise guideline. I was just at a conference where there were over 500 pediatricians in attendance and we talked about this issue for more than a half-hour because this is a real gray area, Sawyer said.Indeed, the CDCs recommendation last month about the meningitis B vaccine pretty much lays the matter right in doctors laps.A bulletin from the agency said recently approved meningitis B vaccines may be administered to young adults ages 16 to 18. But the vaccine has not been added to the nations routine vaccination schedule, and parents are urged to consult their physicians when trying to determine whether to inoculate their children for meningitis.The discussions are taking place following highly publicized meningitis outbreaks that have put parents on edge.In 2013, outbreaks at Princeton University and UC Santa Barbara forced public health departments to import unlicensed strain B vaccine from Europe to immunize thousands of students.A year later, in October 2014, San Diego State vaccinated more than 1,000 students after freshman Sara Stelzer died from a meningitis B infection.Later that same month, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration licensed Trumenba, the first group B vaccine in the nation. In January, the FDA approved a second vaccine, Bexsero, which also prevents meningitis B infection.Many parents especially those who have lost children to the disease, which causes inflammation of brain and spinal cord membranes have advocated for the vaccine to be added to the routine adolescent vaccination schedule.But the CDC did not make that move this summer even though a different vaccine, which prevents four other variants of meningitis, has been on the schedule since 2005.The CDC bulletin on meningitis B vaccination notes that infection is very rare.Among all 11- to 23-year-olds in the U.S., between 50 and 60 cases are reported annually, with five to 10 deaths. According to the CDC, there were seven outbreaks on college campuses from 2009 to 2013, with 41 cases and three deaths.Also, the risk is not spread evenly.Neisseria meningitidis, the bacteria that causes the potentially deadly swelling, spreads through respiratory and throat secretions. Close contact, often through kissing or sharing a cigarette or drink, are the most common ways for the bacteria to move from person to person. Transmission is more common among people who have close-quarters living arrangements, such as college dormitories.Meanwhile, Sawyer said newer vaccines on the market lack comprehensive evidence on safety and effectiveness, compared with vaccines that have been administered to tens of millions of people over decades.Some patients, especially those with a family history of immune-system diseases, can be at higher risk of suffering serious side effects that come with all vaccines including seizures, life-threatening allergic reactions and paralysis.All of these factors must be taken into account by a doctor when deciding whether to recommend vaccination for meningitis B.The best advice is for families to sit down and have a discussion about the risks and benefits, Sawyer said. There is simply no black-and-white answer in this case.Dr. Eric McDonald, medical director of the countys Epidemiology and Immunization Services Branch, agreed.In addition, he noted that while the meningitis B vaccine is new, the existing four-strain vaccine for non-B strains of the bacteria do have a long track record and should definitely be on the vaccination list for families.It is possible for doctors to arrive at differing conclusions about the meningitis B vaccine.McDonald, whose high school-age son is in a boarding school, was scheduled to get the vaccine this week.There is a little higher risk when theyre in a boarding situation, and that happens to be where we are at, McDonald said.But Sawyer said he did not recommend the vaccine for his 21-year-old daughter.I didnt feel that she was at an increased risk, so I didnt have her get the vaccine, Sawyer said.He stressed that parents should realize that there are many more pressing threats on the vaccination front.For example, the odds of becoming infected by human papillomavirus, which can cause a range of cancers in sexually active people, are much higher than they are for bacterial meningitis.That vaccine prevents at least 4,000 or 5,000 cases of cancer each year where the (meningitis) B vaccine prevents five or 10 deaths, Sawyer said. If youre going to worry about your childs vaccines, HPV is pretty important.
