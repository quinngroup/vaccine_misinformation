Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., a noted vaccination skeptic, will chair a commission on vaccine safety and scientific integrity at the request of President-elect Donald Trump, the political scion said Tuesday.Kennedy, following a meeting with Trump inside Trump Tower, told reporters that the point of the commission would to be "to make sure we have scientific integrity in the vaccine process for efficacy and safety effects.""President-elect Trump has some doubts about the current vaccine policies and he has questions about it," Kennedy explained. "His opinion doesn't matter but the science does matter and we ought to be reading the science and we ought to be debating the science.""Everybody ought to be able to be assured that the vaccines that we have, he's very pro-vaccine, as am I, are as safe as they possibly can be," added Kennedy, who himself had his children vaccinated.Kennedy said that Trump requested the meeting, during which the pair discussed "vaccines and immunizations," incoming press secretary Sean Spicer said.Trump, however, later said that he was only considering creating such a comission.The President-elect is exploring the possibility of forming a committee on Autism, which affects so many families; however no decision have been made at this time, his transition team said in a statement provided to The New York Times. "The President-elect looks forward to continuing the discussion about all aspects of Autism with many groups and individuals."Kennedy, the son of the late Robert Kennedy and the nephew of the late John F. Kennedy, has in recent years emerged as one of the most prominent voices in the movement casting suspicion on vaccinations for young children.Kennedy, whose day job is running the Riverkeeper environmental group, has questioned the safety of vaccinating children and suggested that vaccines could be linked to autism a claim the medical community has categorically rejected as untrue and dangerous to public health.Kennedy edited a 2014 book called "Thimerosal: Let the Science Speak," which draws attention to concerns that a preservative used in some in vaccines was linked to brain disorders and autism.In 2015, Kennedy also said that immunizations might even result in a "holocaust" of damage to children."They get the shot, that night they have a fever of a hundred and three, they go to sleep, and three months later their brain is gone," Kennedy said at a Sacramento movie screening. "This is a holocaust, what this is doing to our country."The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Institute of Medicine have repeatedly made clear that there is no evidence showing a link between thimerosal and any brain disorders or autism.Despite that, Trump has also expressed skeptical views regarding vaccinations.The then-Republican president candidate said during a GOP debate in September 2015 that "autism has become an epidemic.""I am totally in favor of vaccines. But I want smaller doses over a longer period of time. Same exact amount, but you take this little beautiful baby, and you pump I mean, it looks just like it's meant for a horse, not for a child, and we've had so many instances, people that work for me," Trump said.He went on to claim he knew of a healthy 2-year-old who, after being vaccinated, developed a fever and was later diagnosed with autism."Just the other day, 2 years old a child, a beautiful child went to have the vaccine, and came back, and a week later got a tremendous fever, got very, very sick, now is autistic," he said without mentioning any other details."Healthy young child goes to doctor, gets pumped with massive shot of many vaccines, doesn't feel good and changes - AUTISM," he tweeted then. "Many such cases!"
