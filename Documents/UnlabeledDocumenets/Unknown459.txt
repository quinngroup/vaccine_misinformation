This petition was started by a citizen and not by MoveOn.Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/pages/Repeal-The-National-Childhood-Vaccine-Injury-Act-of-1986/693229134132332In 1986 Congress granted immunity to vaccine makers against all lawsuits. This is blatantly unfair and un-American. No other industry group is protected in this manner. People in other countries can sue vaccine makers and do but we in America cannot! The US Government is now grudgingly paying billions to parents of children damaged by vaccines, but only after years of litigation. Only 1 in 5 claimants ever gets paid. This, at a time when the vaccine makers such as Merck make billions in profits. Sound familiar? Corporate socialism! The compensation money comes from a $0.75 excise tax that vaccine makers pay for each shot but this is hardly adequate. Families are often burdened with thousands of dollars each year to take care of vaccine injured (sometimes permanently) children. The maximum payout is capped at $250K if a child dies. Clearly Congress decided to serve the corporations rather than the people! THIS HAS TO STOP. NOW!The vaccine makers continue to make more vaccines and are lobbying state legislatures to remove existing personal and religious exemptions (e.g. SB 277 and SB 792 in CA). There is talk of making vaccination mandatory for adults also. Immunity from prosecution for vaccine manufacturers must be repealed because with immunity, vaccine makers have no incentive to make sure vaccines are safe. We want better and safer vaccines. This will happen ONLY if we repeal vaccine manufacturers' immunity.Vaccine makers cannot lobby/pay politicians to force mandates on our kids, grand kids and on us and not pay for the damages their products cause! Our medical freedoms are paramount and no government should force us to inject chemicals into our bodies without our consent! Not in the LAND OF THE FREE!!WE NEED YOUR HELP TO SHARE THIS WITH YOUR COLLEAGUES, FRIENDS AND FAMILY. PLEASE MAKE THIS CAUSE YOUR OWN. TOGETHER, WE CAN GET OUR RIGHTS BACK!! Please comment if you may.Please watch/read and decide for yourself if vaccines are safe or not.1. https://vimeo.com/1267924052. http://vaxxedthemovie.com/3. http://www.thevaccinereaction.org/2016/04/robert-de-niro-debates-autisms-link-to-vaccines-today-2/4. http://www.boughtmovie.net/free-viewing/5. https://vactruth.com/2016/06/03/vaccinated-vs-unvaccinated/6. http://avoiceforchoice.org/OVERALL GOAL: A minimum of 100,000 signatures!
