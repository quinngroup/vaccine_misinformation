Six VTCstaff recentlytook an early morningtrip to Barre, VT, to volunteer at the Vermont Foodbank. We helpedpack 910 boxes (that's 30,030 lbs. and 45,000 meals)of commodity foods that are distributed throughout the state each month to supplement the diet of VT senior citizens, a population that is vulnerable to malnutrition. We had a great time engaging with our Vermont community and hope tohelp at the VT Foodbank again in the future!VTC Researcher/Analyst and Clinical Translational Science Ph.D. student E.
