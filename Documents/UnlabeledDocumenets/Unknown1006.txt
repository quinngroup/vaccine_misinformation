MHRP is dedicated to developing a safe and globally effective HIV vaccine to protect our Armed Forces wherever they may be deployed. In 2009, MHRP announced findings from its landmark Thai Study, RV144 , the first clinical trial to show a vaccine regimen was safe and modestly effective in preventing HIV infection.Today, MHRP continues to pursue several vaccine strategies in the US, East Africa, and Thailand. In addition to building on the success of RV144, MHRP is testing a next-generation MVA vaccine candidate, producing a GP145 vaccine and developing a novel combination HIV-heroinvaccine.
