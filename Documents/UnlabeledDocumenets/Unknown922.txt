Thimerosal (ethyl mercury) is a widely used preservative in biologic and medical products. Since 2001, all vaccines routinely recommended for children 6 years of age and younger are thimerosal-free, with the exception of some formulations of inactivated influenza vaccine. Numerous studies have since shown that there is no relationship between vaccines, either with or without thimerosal, and the development of autism or other neurologic problems in children.
