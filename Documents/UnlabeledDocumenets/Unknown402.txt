Vaccines have significantly reduced the threat of diseases that were once widespread and oftentimes fatal. Today, more people benefit from safe and efficacious vaccines than ever before - and the list of diseases that vaccines can help prevent continues to grow. Vaccines prevent infections from serious, life-threatening diseases and they can also help reduce health care costs to both patients and the broader health care system by reducing the incidence of vaccine-preventable illness.The development of vaccines to prevent serious disease is an extraordinary story of medical achievement - one in which Pfizer and its 'legacy' companies have played a critical role for more than a century.Today, Pfizer is helping to usher in a new era of vaccine innovation - both to prevent and treat disease. We seek to make an impact on the world by taking on bacterial, viral and infectious diseases that threaten people around the globe. We deliver impact through close collaboration with global partners and suppliers and a portfolio that spans all stages of life, enabling us to help protect as many people as possible.
