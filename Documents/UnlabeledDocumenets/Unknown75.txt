The National Vaccine Information Center (NVIC) is a public charity[1] anti-vaccination[2][3] advocacy group.[4] The group was founded in 1982 by parents who blamed routine vaccination for the illness or death of a child. Michael Specter has described the NVIC as "the most powerful anti-vaccine organization in America, and its relationship with the U.S. government consists almost entirely of opposing federal efforts aimed at vaccinating children."[2]The National Vaccine Information Center was co-founded in 1982 by Jeff Schwartz, Barbara Loe Fisher (aka Barbara Loe Arthur),[5] and Kathi Williams.[6] In 1985, Fisher co-authored with Harris Coulter a critique of the mass vaccination system, DPT: A Shot in the Dark,[7] which presented a view of an association between whole cell pertussis (whooping cough) vaccine in the DPT shot and brain and immune system damage believed by many vaccination critics to cause autism.[8]In the early 1980s, NVIC co-founders joined with the American Academy of Pediatrics to draft the original legislation for the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986,[9][10] which created a federal vaccine injury compensation program, mandated that doctors give parents vaccine benefit and risk information, and required the recording and reporting of vaccine injuries and deaths (see Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System). Since then, NVIC has monitored vaccine research, development, regulation, policymaking, and legislation and has criticized mandatory vaccination policies as lacking informed consent protections for individuals.[11]Michael Specter has described the NVIC as:The NVIC argues that there has been inadequate research into the link between the rise in the number of children diagnosed with autism and mass-vaccination programs. There have, however, been a number of peer-reviewed studies and meta-analyses which have shown no correlation between vaccine administration and autism diagnosis.[12][13][14][15]The NVIC received criticism in April 2011 for ads that it placed on a jumbotron in Times Square.[16][17] The ads criticized childhood immunization and promoted an alternative medicine website. In a letter to CBS, the owner of the jumbotron, the American Academy of Pediatrics stated, "By providing advertising space to an organization like the NVIC . . . you are putting thousands of lives of children at risk."[18]Another controversial ad produced by NVIC and aired on some of the flights on Delta Air Lines regarding preventive measures for influenza prompted the president of the American Academy of Pediatrics to write a letter to the CEO of Delta on Nov 4, 2011 and urged Delta to 'remove these harmful messages'.[19][20] An online petition is also set up to urge Delta to remove the ads.[19][20]The refusal of Delta Air Lines to immediately stop showing the ad prompted the Institute for Science in Medicine to protest, calling the decision:In 1997, the NVIC began hosting an anti-vaccine conference to provide a voice to those who argue that vaccines can cause serious adverse effects. The first such conference was held in Alexandria, Virginia. Some notable presenters at the conferences have been Mark Geier, Andrew Wakefield, Boyd Haley, Robert Sears, Joseph Mercola, Gary Null, and Dan Olmsted. All of these hold non-mainstream views toward vaccination. Most dispute large bodies of scientific research, while Geier and Wakefield have lost their medical practice licenses.
