I was just listening to the latest fear-mongering on NBC Nightly News and most of what was said was the same-ole, same-ole regarding the Disneyland measles outbreak. Until. the vaccine has virtually no side-effects.Im really trying to be a G-rated person here, so.The first thing I would recommend is reading the vaccine-manufacturers insert, which you can get here.Please seePRECAUTIONSbeginning on page 5, and ADVERSE REACTIONSbeginning on page 6 and continuing through page 8.When you get through with the vaccine-manufacturers insert, please check out the Vaccine Injury Compensation Programs page here.And then, read this article about the case of Hannah Poling, who regressed into autism after a round of vaccines, including the MMR vaccine. You should also know that despite what you have been told by mainstream media news outlets (who are funded by advertising dollars from pharmaceutical companies), there have been several children whose autism has been recognized by the United States government, and those families have been awarded a portion of the nearly $3 BILLION (in tax dollars yep you paid for it) to compensate those families and to pay for the life-long care their children will require.After that, please go to this article, which contains dozens of links to peer-reviewed medical literature dating back decades, documenting the harms from the MMR vaccine and guess what? Its not just about autism.Virtually no side effects? In what universe?
