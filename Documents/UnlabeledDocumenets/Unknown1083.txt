Caroline Williams, 33, lost her son just months before it was announced that babies would be routinely vaccinated against the meningitis strain that killed him.However, she has been forced to go private and pay 500 to vaccinate her surviving son, born just nine months after baby Cadens death, because he will not be covered by the much heralded childhood immunisation programme.This is despite Government fanfare that the vaccine, expected to be rolled out in September, will save the lives of hundreds of children a year. Ms Williams, who lives with her partner Philip, in Tredegar, South Wales, yesterday spoke of her anger that five-month-old son Kelyn is not eligible for the vaccination, which will be given to babies up to four months old on the NHS.She told the Sunday Express: I have been fighting since before he was eight weeks old to try to get them to give Kelyn the vaccine in the GPs surgery but they wouldnt do it.By the time the vaccine is introduced on the NHS, Kelyn will be nine months old, so will miss out on getting the vaccine. As soon as I realised that he would not be eligible for the jab, I booked him in to have his first dose privately.Having already lost one child of course money was no object but I was angry when I realised that not every child would receive it.By the time Kelyn receives his booster next year I will have spent 500 but there are other people, even within my own family, who have three children or more who cannot afford that kind of money and they shouldnt have to.That is why I want to see this vaccination programme widened to include all the at risk groups, which includes children under five and also teenagers.Caden died in March last year after the rapid onset of meningitis. He began the day a healthy baby boy exploring a play centre with his auxiliary healthcare assistant mum but became increasingly unwell during the course of the day.
