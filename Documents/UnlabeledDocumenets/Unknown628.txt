The North Carolina Immunization Program (NCIP) works in conjunction with the federal vaccine supply program, called the Vaccines for Children (VFC) program. The VFC program is a federal initiative created to help families of children who may not otherwise have access to vaccines by providing free vaccines to doctors who serve them.Children through 18 years of age that meet at least one of the following criteria are eligible for VFC vaccine:Funds for the VFC program are transferred every year from the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) to the CDC and awarded to the North Carolina Immunization Program. About 90 percent of these funds are used for the purchase of childhood vaccines. The remaining funds are used by the NCIP for program operational activities such as provider enrollment, program evaluation, and vaccine accountability activities.
