As the recent measles outbreak so vividly shows us, vaccine-preventable diseases can be a threat to our health. APHA promotes immunization of the world's children as well as throughout the lifespan.Do vaccines work? Think about it: As the 2014 Ebola outbreak raged in West Africa, no vaccine was available, so thousands of people became very sick and more than 9,000 have died. In the case of measles, in the decade before 1963 when a vaccine became available, nearly all children got measles by the time they were 15. Up to 4 million people in the United States were infected each year, 400-500 people died, 48,000 were hospitalized, and 4,000 suffered encephalitis, or swelling of the brain. Now, two doses of measles vaccine are about 97 percent effective at preventing measles if someone is exposed to the virus.
