These emerging infections have been at the forefront of cutting-edge research, rapid product development and clinical evaluation and we are excited to invite you to join with colleagues from industry and academia to discuss them at GTCbios 15th Annual Vaccines Research & Development Conference. This meeting will take place July 13-14, 2017 in Baltimore, MD as part of the larger Infectious Diseases Summit.Current support by NIH, DoD and BARDA, Eli Lilly, GlaxoSmithKline and more demonstrate recognition by federal agencies and large pharmaceutical companies the necessity for innovative vaccines for emerging pathogens. Therefore, the focus of this conference will be to evaluate the lessons learned from both the academic and industry responses during past epidemics for translation to next-generation research with new pathogens for use in future outbreaks. Sessions will focus on defining emerging global health threats (Zika, multi-drug resistant TB, influenza), discussing next generation technologies to address these foes (novel adjuvants, DC vaccines, nucleic acid vaccines, recombinant viral vectors) and addressing challenges to those goals.Additionally, we will have a session focused on how best to create these assets for those most vulnerable populations on both ends of the age spectrum a topic that has recently arose as an important consideration. Over the course of this meeting attendees will have ample opportunity to engage and network with speakers and panelists.We hope to see you there!
