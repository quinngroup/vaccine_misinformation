Up, up and away!This pretty much describes the CDC Childhood Immunization Schedule since 1950.On February 1, 2016, the insanity continued as the CDC hiked the childhood immunization schedule even further by adding another 3 vaccinations and lowering the age for the first HPV jab (Gardasil) to 9 years old. The total is now an outrageous 74 doses (53 injections) by age 17, an increase of 24X since 1950.Have our children become pin cushions of profit for the drug companies?Heres the breakdown. You decide.These rapid increases in the vaccine schedule mean that a 6 month old baby born today would receive over 2.5 times the number of vaccines as the maximum permitted for a 6 year old back in the 1980s. And, by the time that same baby was 12 years old, he/she would have received over 7X the number of vaccines as a child born 30 years ago. Predictably, children today are suffering from autoimmune disorders, behavioral problems, and physical disabilities at a rate growing in lockstep with the skyrocketing number of shots. One in every two children suffers from a chronic problem today and the situation is only growing worse with each passing year.The CDC will never stop adding to the immunization schedule as long as pharmaceutical manufacturers are protected from ALL liability of injury and death. There are currently 271 new vaccines in the pipeline just waiting to be finalized and gain approval from the FDA (1). There is absolutely no incentive to make existing or new vaccines safe or keep the schedule at a reasonable level since the passage of the1986 Vaccine Injury Act (2).Will you be following the newly revised CDC Childhood Immunization Schedule or have you concluded as I did 18 years ago that the risks to your childs long term health from following this insane vaccination schedule far outweigh the small risks of not vaccinating (3)?For those that want to know the exact changes to the CDC immunization schedule, here are the most notable changes as outlined by Medscape:
