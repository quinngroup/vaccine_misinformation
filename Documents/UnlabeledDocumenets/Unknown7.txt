With more vaccine solutions available and opportunities for earlier availability of new vaccine products in resource-limited countries (e.g. vaccines against rotavirus, human papillomavirus or pneumococci) as well as new products that address diseases endemic in those countries only (e.g. malaria, dengue among others), generating reliable data about specific safety concerns is becoming a priority for all countries. The Guide offers a practical step-by-step approach and algorithm to aid immunization professionals and decision-makers in determining the best course of action if additional vaccine safety data is needed.
