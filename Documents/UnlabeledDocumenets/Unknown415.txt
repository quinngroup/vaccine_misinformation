Welcome to the website of the International Society for Vaccines.ISV is a not-for profit organization that aims to encourage, establish and promote the development and the use of vaccines to prevent and control infectious and non-infectious diseases in humans and animals. ISV is truly international, with members coming from all over the world, and from all sectors (academia, industry, non-governmental and governmental vaccine institutions, and foundations). The ISV annual Congress is the worlds largest scientific conference in the field of vaccines and covers a broad range of topics related to prophylactic vaccines and immunotherapies for both human and veterinary diseases, and covering from basic science immunology all the way through manufacturing and clinical trials. ISV also publishes a newsletter that in addition to keeping members up-to-date on the activities of the Society, highlights important recently published papers, provides points-of-view about key issues from senior members, highlights events and summaries of important related conferences, and serves as a go-to site for all things vaccine since ISV has ties with a number of other vaccine organizations.ISV seeks to foster the scientific and career development of vaccinologists, and does so by annual career development workshops at the annual Congress, by offering mentoring for individuals at all stages of their career, and by providing awards enabling younger scientists to both attend the Congress and have their work recognized. The international nature of the membership and the presence of many of the most prominent vaccinologists makes ISV truly a global community for raising up the next generation of scientists and developing the careers of members. ISV elects distinguished scientists to serve as Fellows, whose contributions to the Society and the world of vaccinology include contributing their expertise in many ways such as serving on the Scientific Committee of the Congress, contributing points of views for the Newsletter. Involvement in the Society is an excellent activity for scientists from all stages of their careers to establish collaborations, to mentor or be mentored, and to increase their prominence on the international level.
