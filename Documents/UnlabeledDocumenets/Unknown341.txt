Your new puppy definitely needs a series of vaccinations in the first year of life to protect him from many dangerous diseases as his doggy immune system develops. Different veterinarians recommend slightly different vaccination schedules and vaccines according to the specific dogs risk factors.Your vet can be more specific about the vaccination needs based on your individual dog, the particular region of the country in which you live, and your individual circumstances. In general, however, the first-year vaccination schedule for puppies usually resembles the schedule in the table here.Getting your adult dog vaccinated may be more controversial than you think. Some people, including many vets, believe adult pets are overvaccinated and think that too many vaccinations pose health risks. Others believe vaccinations should be performed yearly to keep dangerous diseases like distemper from getting a hold on the pet population like they did in decades past.Your adult dog may not need annual vaccinations and can instead have titer tests tests that check a dogs immunity levels to determine exactly which vaccinations are needed. One exception is the rabies vaccine, which is regulated by law and may be required every one to three years, depending on where you live and the type of rabies vaccine the vet uses.
