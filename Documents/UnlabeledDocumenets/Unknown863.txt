Herd immunity is when enough people in a community are vaccinated against a disease so that if someone gets infected, the disease wont be able to spread from person to person it gets contained. This creates a protective effect for the entire community, and not just those who are inoculated, pediatric infectious disease specialist Dr. Kate OBrien, executive director of the International Vaccine Access Center at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, tells BuzzFeed Life.That protective effect is important because some people cant be vaccinated, for medical reasons, OBrien says. People with a compromised immune system from a genetic immunodeficiency or from receiving chemotherapy for cancer, for instance. And also very young kids babies often cant be vaccinated for certain diseases (including measles) before a certain age. Herd immunity protects these people.
