Its not a big secret that its important to be careful what we put into our bodies. Obviously eating junk food everyday will have very different consequences on ones health than consuming fresh fruits and vegetables on a daily basis.When eating processed foods, if quality of diet is of concern, one has to read labels to make sure products dont contain items that are known to be detrimental to health, such as high fructose corn syrup or MSG. And when it comes to people who have food sensitivies, they have to be very careful to avoid foods that are triggers for them, even if that type of food is just fine for many other people.So if we are concerned with our health, we must be very careful what we put into our bodies or what we put on our bodies that is absorbed through the skin.When it comes to vaccinations, most parents have never thought twice what is in the syringe that is injected into their child. Yes, they know its a vaccine, but whats in a vaccine?Vaccines contain a killed, inactivated or portion of a toxin or pathogen such as a virus or bacteria so that the immune system can react to it and attempt to provide the desired immunity. However, since the inactive toxin or pathogen is not a threat, there must be something in the vaccine to provide the necessary reaction to get the immune system to respond. This ingredient is called an adjuvant. The most commonadjuvant in vaccines today is aluminum.In addition to an adjuvant, vaccines can contain preservatives such as thimerosal (which has been removed from childhood vaccines, but they still contain trace amounts), stabilizers such as MSG, toxin inactivators such as formaldehyde and residuals from the growth medium to name a few.For vaccines that are developed on animal tissue (such as the polio vaccine from monkey kidney) vaccines must contain antibiotics to deal with bacteria from the diseased animal tissue. For vaccines that are developed on aborted fetal tissue, vaccines contain residual human DNA.One argument for the safety of using these ingredients in vaccines is that they are in such small amounts that they couldnt pose a risk. There is a major problem with that argument, in that we can say nothing of the safety of injecting these ingredients into infants because there have been no safety studies done of doing just that.When one study did look at what would happen if the aluminum used in vaccines was injected into mice, they found it caused neurological damage.Aluminum hydroxide injections lead to motor deficits and motor neuron degeneration, Christopher A.
