Flu season is here again and with it come invitations to large swathes of the population to get themselves protected. So lets start by getting a few myths out of the way. Never a week goes by in my surgery during flu season without at least one patient bringing up all of them!Although the groups offered flu immunisation arent necessarily more likely to get flu than anyone else, they are more likely to get serious complications. Every year, the Department of Health asks GPs to invite everyone in high-risk groups to get protected with the flu immunisation. This year, those groups include:GPs have been asked to work specially hard to encourage pregnant women to get vaccinated. Its inevitable that if youre pregnant, youre extra keen to avoid anything that might harm your baby. But a new study offers very reassuring evidence that pregnant women who are immunised against flu reduce their risk of losing their babies.There have also been lots of headlines about all children being offered flu immunisation using a new nasal spray. However, thats not likely to happen for a couple of years. In the meantime, if you do have a child in an 'at-risk' category, do make sure you take up the offer of immunisation, which you should get from your GP in the next week or two.So if you get that letter through the door inviting you, dont ignore it. If you do, you might find out the hard way that the last myth side-effects of the vaccine are worse than getting flu' is a lot of nonsense too.Disclaimer: This article is for information only and should not be used for the diagnosis or treatment of medical conditions.
