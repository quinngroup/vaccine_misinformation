Dear Peeps, I NEED YOU. I made a personal decision this week that I could either go numb from the constant barrage of everyone losing people and just give up and shut down this page or I could go hard. I'm going hard. I need you to support this Thunderclap. I need you to fight with me. Don't go numb. Go hard with me.Signing this Thunderclap costs you absolutely nothing. If I can get a minimum of 100 people to support this, Thunderclap will send out a one day blast asking p...eople to join our page. It will post the blast on your Facebook page once on March 8th. It has room for you to add a personal note. The more people sign up the more viral we go. I believe with every fiber of my being that there is strength in numbers. We need bigger numbers. If you have any questions just lmk.
