The VFC program is a federal entitlement program that eliminates cost as a barrier and improves immunization levels, and is a critical funding source for vaccines.Since 1990, Washington State has maintained a universal childhood vaccine program, providing vaccines to all children less than 19 years regardless of income. Washingtons universal status has meant that whatever vaccines are provided for VFC-eligible children, the state also provides to non-VFC eligible children. No child can be denied state-supplied vaccine because of their inability to pay an administration or office visit fee and no child can be charged for state-supplied vaccine.The resources listed here may help you prepare for and complete the process:For more information related to Vaccines for Children Program please visit their website.
