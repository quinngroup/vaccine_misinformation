The diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (DTaP) vaccine protects against:DTaP immunizations are given as a series of five injections, usually administered at ages:A vaccine called Tdap (the booster shot) should be given at ages 11 to 12, and to older teens and adults who haven't yet had a booster with pertussis coverage. Then, Td (tetanus and diphtheria) boosters are recommended every 10 years.Pregnant women should get the Tdap vaccine in the second half of each pregnancy, even if they've been vaccinated in the past. Tdap also can be given after a deep cut or severe burn to prevent tetanus infection.Use of the DTaP vaccine has virtually eliminated diphtheria and tetanus in childhood and has greatly reduced the number of pertussis cases.The vaccine frequently causes mild side effects: fever; mild crankiness; tiredness; loss of appetite; and tenderness, redness, or swelling in the area where the shot was given.Rarely, a child may have a seizure or cry uncontrollably after getting the vaccine. But these sorts of side effects are so rare that researchers question whether they're even caused by the vaccine. Most kids have a few minor or no side effects.Your doctor might decide to just give a partial vaccine or no vaccine, or may determine that the benefits of vaccinating your child outweigh the potential risks.Your child may have a fever, soreness, and some swelling and redness in the area where the shot was given. For pain and fever, check with your doctor to see if you can give either acetaminophen or ibuprofen, and to find out the appropriate dose.A warm, damp cloth or a heating pad on the injection site may help reduce soreness, as can moving or using the arm.
