It could be closer than you think.A team of Cleveland Clinic researchers led by Vincent Tuohy, PhD, recently made discoveries toward what could become the first-ever vaccine to prevent breast cancer.It works in the lab. Now, we need to see if it works in women."We envision a future in which we control breast cancer by preventing it in the same way we prevent childhood infectious diseases by targeted vaccination that directs a womans own immune system to protect herself from developing breast cancer," says Dr. Tuohy.The research team is poised to take this discovery from the lab to clinical trial in this decade. Your gift today could help jump-start human trials.
