Measles, Mumps, and Rubella Vaccination and Bowel Problems or Developmental Regression in Children with Autism: Population Study Population study of 278 children with core autism and 195 with atypical autism, born between 1979 and 1998. The proportion of children with developmental regression (25% overall) or bowel symptoms (17%) did not change significantly during the 20 years from 1979, a period which included the introduction of measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccination in October 1988. Data provide no support for an MMR associated new variant form of autism with developmental regression and bowel problems, and further evidence against involvement of MMR vaccine in the initiation of autism.Prevalence of Autism and Parentally Reported Triggers in a North East London PopulationLingam R, e Study of reported age of onset of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) among 567 children in northeast London born between 1979 and 1998. The age at diagnosis of ASD was estimated to have decreased per five-year period since 1983, by 8.7% for childhood autism and by 11.0% for atypical autism. There was some evidence that measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine was more likely to be mentioned as a trigger after August 1997 than before. The data suggest that a rise in autism prevalence was likely due to factors such as increased recognition, a greater willingness on the part of educators and families to accept the diagnostic label, and better recording systems. The proportion of parents attributing their child's autism to MMR appears to have increased since August 1997.
