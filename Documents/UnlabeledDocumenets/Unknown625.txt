Introduced in 1994 by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), New Jersey VFC is a federally funded, state-operated vaccine supply program that provides pediatric vaccines at no cost to doctors who serve children who might not otherwise be vaccinated because of inability to pay. Physicians may charge office visit and administration fees based on a government fee schedule. There are over 1,000 medical offices enrolled in the New Jersey VFC program and the majority are private providers. - Due to changes implemented by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, vaccines supplied by the New Jersey Vaccines for Children (NJVFC) Program will no longer be able to be accessed for individuals insured by NJ Family Care Plans B, C and D effective July 1, 2014. This change applies only to those individuals who are insured by NJ FamilyCare Plans B, C and D who will now have their vaccinations covered directly through the Division of Medical Assistance and Health Services. For further details about this policy change, please read the newsletter from the Department of Human Services, Division of Medical Assistance & Health Services. Click for more information.
