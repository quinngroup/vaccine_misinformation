Located within the Center for Infectious Disease Research, the Human Challenge Center is a unique, specialized facility designed to challenge human volunteers with the malaria parasite. The primary goals of the HCC are to assess the safety and efficacy of malaria vaccine candidates, including genetically attenuated whole parasite vaccines and malaria prophylaxis. The Human Challenge Center is one of only a handful of facilities of its kind in the world where sporozoites are inoculated via mosquito bite to humans under a meticulously regulated process. Here we have the ability to both manufacture malaria infected mosquitoes and deliver a controlled human malaria infection to healthy individuals in early phase trials. The HCC supports and fosters joint clinical trials for malaria vaccine and drug development by establishing and maintaining key partnerships in the community to diversify capabilities, ensure sustainability, and increase capacity. Overall, the HCC and its collaborators have conducted over 60 CHMI challenges in healthy adults, with more than 85 additional infectious mosquito-borne administrations of Plasmodium falciparum to healthy adults under experimental conditions.Volunteer here!
