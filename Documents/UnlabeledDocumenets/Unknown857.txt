A year after the State Government introduced the 'no jab, no play' policy making it mandatory for children attending pre-school to be vaccinated, Victoria's immunisation rate remains a problem.Currently about 7 per cent of Victorian children under the age of six are not vaccinated, leaving holes in the state's so-called herd immunity.Toddler Sonny Mara has a rare immune deficiency disorder that prevents him generating anti-bodies.He cannot fight infection and disease which means he cannot be vaccinated."His body doesn't respond to vaccinations", his mother Caitlin Mara said.Sonny is reliant on herd immunity to stop him contracting preventable diseases.He needs the children around him to be vaccinated."We believe it's important for others to be immunised to keep the community healthy, and to keep Sonny as healthy as he can be throughout his life," Ms Mara said.Herd immunity requires vaccination rates to be at least 95 per cent of the population.Several Victorian communities have immunisations rates below 90 per cent, including Hepburn in regional Victoria and the city areas of Melbourne and Port Phillip.Gippsland has the best vaccination rate in Victoria at 96 per cent.The Victorian Government is ramping up efforts to achieve a 95 per cent vaccination rate across the state.It is spending $750,000 on a new advertising campaign to encourage vaccination.Health Minister Jill Hennessy said the ads reminded parents that children must be vaccinated to participate in childcare and other early childhood services."And to encourage people to get their information from GPs, not from crackpots on the internet," she said.Dr Margaret Cooper, who features in one of the new advertisements, contracted polio when she was four and is confined to a wheelchair."Both legs my arm and my back were all affected seriously," she said.There is still no treatment for polio, but it has been virtually eradicated in Australia through vaccination.Dr Cooper urged parents with philosophical objections to vaccination to put them aside and put their children first."They've got to look at their child's needs. They've got to look at what they want for their child."
