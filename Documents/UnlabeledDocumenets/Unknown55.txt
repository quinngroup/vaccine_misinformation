Vaccines have reduced and, in some cases, eliminated many diseases that killed or severely disabled children and adults just a few generations ago. For most Americans today, vaccines are a routine part of healthcare.However, the disappearance of many childhood diseases has led some parents to question whether vaccines are still necessary. In addition, a growing number of parents are concerned that vaccines may actually be the cause of conditions such as autism, hyperactivity, diabetes, multiple sclerosis (MS), and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). These concerns have caused some parents to delay or withhold vaccines for their children.As a result, MDH has put this site together to provide accurate, comprehensive and up-to-date information about childhood vaccines and the diseases they prevent for parents and health-care professionals.
