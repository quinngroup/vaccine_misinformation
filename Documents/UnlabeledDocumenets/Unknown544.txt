Hepatitis A and B are serious diseases caused by virus.Hepatitis A is spread through contact with the stool (bowel movements) of a person infected with the hepatitis A virus. This usually occurs by eating food or drinking water that has become contaminated as a result of handling by an infected person.Hepatitis B is spread through blood or bodily fluids, sexual contact or sharing IV drug needles with an infected person, or during childbirth when a baby is born to a mother who is infected.Hepatitis causes inflammation of the liver, vomiting, and jaundice (yellowing of the skin or eyes). Hepatitis can lead to liver cancer, cirrhosis, or death.The hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccine is used to help prevent these diseases. The vaccine works by exposing you to a small dose of the virus, which causes the body to develop immunity to the disease.
