This is a dynamic list and may never be able to satisfy particular standards for completeness. You can help by expanding it with reliably sourced entries.This list of vaccine ingredients indicates the culture media used in the production of common vaccines and the excipients they contain. Most vaccines listed are produced on cultures containing either egg, which are allowed to contain 0.05 mg/Kg glyphosate residues,[1] or Bovine serum albumin, which are from cows allowed to eat fodder that contain 500 mg/Kg glyphosate residues.[2] Also listed are substances used in the manufacturing process.[3]To read the prescribing information for each individual vaccine, see List of Licensed VaccinesThe initial list is based on information from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and thus limited to US-approved vaccines.
