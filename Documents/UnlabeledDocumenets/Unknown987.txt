The Mucosal and Vaccine Research Colorado (MAVRC) program promotes disease prevention by fostering collaborative and innovative research to understand human immunology, mucosal and vaccine biology.Mucosal tissues are the moist surfaces of the body that provide the first line of host defense. These surfaces most often successfully exclude harmful elements from the body. However, the most common infections (pneumonia, ear and urinary tract infections, gingivitis, diarrhea and HIV/AIDS) and cancers (lung, colon, breast, and prostate)begin at the mucosa.Creative solutions to prevent infections, cancer and immunologic diseases can only succeed if diverse investigators work and think together across preconceived boundaries. MAVRC endeavors to identify support to integrate the talents, both conceptual and technical, of University of Colorado scientists and clinicians who recognize, and strive to combat, the problems that affect our state, our country, and our world.
