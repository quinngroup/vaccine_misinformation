This schedule of recommended immunizations may vary depending upon where you live, your child's health, the type of vaccine, and the vaccines available.Some of the vaccines may be given as part of a combination vaccine so that a child gets fewer shots. Talk with your doctor about which vaccines your kids should receive.
