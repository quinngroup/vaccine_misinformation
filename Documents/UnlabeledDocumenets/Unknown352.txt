The following vaccine protocol is offered for those dogs where minimal vaccinations are advisable or desirable. The schedule is one I recommend and should not be interpreted to mean that other protocols recommended by a veterinarian would be less satisfactory. Its a matter of professional judgment and choice.18 weeks of ageParvovirus only, MLVNote: New research states that last puppy parvovirus vaccine should be at 18 weeks old.20 weeks or older, if allowable by lawRabies give 3-4 weeks apart from other vaccinesMercury-free (thimerosol-free, TF)1 year oldDistemper + Parvovirus, MLVThis is an optional booster or titer. If the client intends not to booster after this optional booster or intends to retest titers in another three years, this optional booster at puberty is wise.1 year oldRabies give 3-4 weeks apart from other vaccines3-year product if allowable by law; mercury-free (TF) Perform vaccine antibody titers for distemper and parvovirus every three years thereafter, or more often, if desired. Vaccinate for rabies virus according to the law, except where circumstances indicate that a written waiver needs to be obtained from the primary care veterinarian. In that case, a rabies antibody titer can also be performed to accompany the waiver request. Visit The Rabies Challenge Fund for more information.
