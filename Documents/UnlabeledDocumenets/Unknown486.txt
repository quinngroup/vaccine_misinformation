The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) is a Federal "no-fault" system designed to compensate individuals, or families of individuals, who have been injured by childhood vaccines, whether administered in the private or public sector. The VICP is a no-fault alternative to the traditional tort system for resolving vaccine injury claims that provides compensation to people found to be injured by certain vaccines. The U. S. Court of Federal Claims decides who will be paid. Three Federal government offices have a role in the VICP:The VICP is located in the HHS, Health Resources and Services Administration, Healthcare Systems Bureau, Division of Vaccine Injury Compensation.
