Through collaboration with public and private providers, advocacy groups, and other stakeholders, work to increase immunization rates for all Georgians and decrease the incidence of vaccine-preventable diseases.Vaccine-preventable disease levels are at or near record lows. Even though most infants and toddlers have received all recommended vaccines by age 2, many under-immunized children remain, leaving the potential for outbreaks of disease. Many adolescents and adults are under-immunized as well, missing opportunities to protect themselves against diseases such as Hepatitis B, influenza, and pneumococcal disease.For more information regarding immunization, visit the links provided.
