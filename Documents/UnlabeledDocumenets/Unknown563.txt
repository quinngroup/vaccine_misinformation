As a parent, you want to keep your kids safe. If you're wondering about vaccine side effects, you may find it comforting to know that vaccinations used in Canada must meet very high standards for safety. The average vaccine is researched, developed, and tested for 10 years before it can be used by the public. And even after a vaccine becomes available, the Public Health Agency of Canada continues to closely monitor its safety.Like any medication, vaccines can cause side effects. But it's important to put this in perspective by balancing the risks and benefits.The side effects of vaccines are usually minor. The most common side effects are mild fever; irritability; and pain, soreness, or redness at the place where the vaccine was given. These side effects usually go away in a day or two and can be managed (see below). Serious side effects are extremely rare - less than one in a million doses of the vaccine. If they do occur, these reactions can be treated.The benefits of vaccines are enormous. Childhood vaccines can help protect your child from 13 diseases that can cause serious illness, permanent disability (including blindness, deafness, brain damage, or paralysis), or even death. Before vaccines were available, many children were disabled or killed by these diseases.Overall, the risks of not being vaccinated are much greater than the risks of vaccination. The benefits of vaccines greatly outweigh the risks. If you have questions about side effects, speak to your child's HCP . Tell your child's HCP about your child's allergies or medical conditions, since these may affect which vaccinations your child can receive.
