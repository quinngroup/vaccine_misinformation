The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) offers easy-to-read vaccine schedules for all ages. For easy-to-read formats to print, tools to download and ways to prepare for your next doctor's visit, please visit the CDC Website.The recommended immunization schedule is designed to protect infants and children early in life, when they are most vulnerable and before they are exposed to potentially life-threatening diseases.The recommended immunization schedules list the age or age range when each vaccine or series of shots is recommended. If your preteen or teen (age 7 through 18 years old) has missed any shots, check with the doctor about getting back on track.If your children missed some vaccines along the way, use these recommended catch-up schedules to get caught up. These summarize the recommended vaccines for children age 18 and younger.Vaccines that might be indicated for children and adolescents aged 18 years or younger based on medical indications.You never outgrow the need for vaccines. The specific immunizations you need as an adult are determined by factors such as your age, lifestyle, high-risk conditions, type and locations of travel, and previous immunizations.People with immune deficiency may be at increased risk for certain vaccine-preventable diseases, but they also may be at increased risk for adverse events following receipt of certain vaccines. It is always best for immunocompromised patients to consult with their healthcare provider to determine which vaccines they can safely receive.
