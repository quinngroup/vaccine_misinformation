The Council for Vaccine Safety is a non-profit organization, founded by a former pharmaceutical representative, aiming to raise awareness of vaccine risks through public education. Lets face it, we have a broken vaccine system in the US. Toxic vaccines, given in record numbers, are harming our children at epidemic proportions. Yet, as long asvaccines arethe only products in the US with complete federal liability protection, there are absolutely no incentives for vaccine makers, aka pharmaceutical companies, to change the way they do things.Here at CFVS, we arent afraid to tell it like it is. We believe every parent deserves the real information on vaccines, before your child becomes another statistic. We believe adults should know what they are putting into their bodies, before they roll up their sleeves. We are lifting the veil on whats driving the push for mandatory vaccinations and an overinflated vaccination schedule its not about pubic health anymore, its about profit.
