The Vaccines for Children (VFC) Program is a federal program that buys and provides all vaccines recommended for children younger than 19 years who do not have insurance to cover the cost of vaccines. About half of children in Tennessee are eligible. In Tennessee, VFC vaccines are available at all local health departments and through more than 500 other clinics statewide enrolled in the VFC Program. Most pediatricians and many family doctors who see children participate in the VFC Program.Your child is eligible for vaccines from the VFC Program if he or she is younger than 19 years of age and is one of the following: Medicaid-eligible (TennCare, even if TennCare is not the child's primary insurance) Uninsured Underinsured ** American Indian or Alaska Native **Underinsured means your child has health insurance with one of the following limits: Doesn't cover any vaccines, or Doesn't cover certain vaccines (VFC-eligible for those vaccines only), or Covers vaccines, but only as part of a limited yearly budget, or cap, on money it will pay to cover preventive services. In Tennessee, children in the "underinsured" group can receive VFC vaccine at local health departments or at federally qualified health centers, but not through private practice clinics that participate in VFC. Children whose insurance has a high deductible or co-pay are NOT considered "underinsured" and not eligible for VFC. Children enrolled in the Cover Tennessee program (CoverKids or CoverTN) are not eligible for the VFC Program. Parents or guardians with questions about VFC eligibility may contact their child's healthcare provider or local health department.
