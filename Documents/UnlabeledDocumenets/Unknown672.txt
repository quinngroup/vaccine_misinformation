EmblemHealth requires all eligible Child Health Plus (CHPlus) and Medicaid providers to participate in the Vaccines for Children (VFC) Program. The VFC Program is a New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH) and New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (NYCDOHMH) program that distributes free vaccines to eligible providers that serve CHPlus/Medicaid members under 19 years of age within New York City (Bronx, Kings, New York, Queens andRichmond counties) and Nassau, Suffolk and Westchester counties. Members that meet these criteria are commonly referred to as VFC-eligible members.Although vaccinations are a covered benefit for CHPlus/Medicaid members, EmblemHealth is not responsible for the cost of the vaccines available through the VFC Program.EmblemHealth will only reimburse providers for the cost of administering vaccines to VFC-eligible members. Providers are required to bill vaccine administration code 90460 for administration of vaccines supplied by VFC, including influenza and pneumococcal administration. For reimbursement purposes, the administration of the components of a combination vaccine continues to be considered as one vaccine administration. More than one vaccine administration is reimbursable under vaccine administration code 90460 on a single date of service.The following is a list of the CPT codes for vaccines that will be auto-denied when administered to any VFC-eligible members under age 19:Please see the Pharmacy Services chapter of the Provider Manual for more information on the VFC Program.
