Almost everyone believes that vaccines have been instrumental in bringing down disease rates around the world.As soon as our babies are born we are sold on the benefits of vaccinating and warned of the risks of being exposed to deadly diseasesGovernment, health institutions, doctors, healthcare professionals, family and friends all give us the benefit of their opinions about the vital need for vaccinesAnd yet in spite of all this pressure a growing percentage of parents are deciding their childrens health will be better served by not vaccinating.We know that the vast majority of parents do agree to vaccinate their children because they believe their doctors and health professionals understand better than them the balance of the risks of vaccinating versus the benefits of being apparently unprotected from these illnesses.However you may be shocked to know that most healthcare professionals are unaware of some of the most basic arguments which question the safety and effectiveness of vaccines eg.Parents that do question the safety of vaccines or the need to have them so soon after their babies are born often feel they are placed under enormous pressure to vaccinate. The pressure is applied usually before they have had time to adjust to being a new parent and certainly before they have had time to come to a considered opinion about vaccinations.Is it any wonder that most parents simply give in to the pressure to vaccinate when you consider the many scare stories in the press about the problems associated with lower than usual uptakes of vaccine schedules and the epidemics of childhood illnesses that are threatening to make every unprotected child a frightening health statistic, not to mention the non expert, expert opinions from our nearest and dearest.To achieve this we bring together the disciplines of biomedical science and holistic medicine to help interpret the available research into the health impact of lifestyle issues, foods, toxins, drugs and vaccines.We help teach parents how to assess the risks from vaccinating against the risks from childhood diseases so that they can make their own decisions about what is best for their childrens healthTo help you to feel confident that the decision you are about to take is the right one, we have condensed 20 years of study into a short easy to read eBook and its freeIt summarises the arguments both for and against vaccinations so that you can begin the process of making up your own mind as to what is best for your childs short and long term healthThis eBook will help you if youre:If you want more balanced answers to any of the questions you now have about vaccines then you will certainly benefit from having access to this eBook.For a limited period this eBook is being offered for free to parents like you that may be finding it difficult to get access to the information you need to feel confident about making one of the most important health decisions for your children.
