As a parent, you want to do whatever you can to protect your child and keep them safe and healthy. Vaccines are an important way to do that.For newborns, breast milk can help protect against many diseases. It contains antibodies passed from the mother. However, this immunity wears off within a year, and many children arent breastfed to begin with. In both cases, vaccines can help protect babies and small children from disease. They can also help prevent the spread of disease to older children and adults.Vaccines imitate infection of a certain disease in your body. This prompts your immune system to develop weapons called antibodies. These antibodies fight the disease that the vaccine is meant to prevent. With them in place, your body can defeat any future infection with the disease.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) decides which vaccines should be given to people in the United States. They recommend that several vaccines be given during childhood. Read on to learn more about their recommendations.
