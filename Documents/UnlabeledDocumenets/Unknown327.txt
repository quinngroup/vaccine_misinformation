Americans have been carefully taught to fully trust the recommendations made by medical doctors and public health officials,and many do trust without questioning.After all, we expect and want to believe that the recommendations being made by the medical experts are evidence-based and thoroughly tested for safety.In the case of the childhood vaccine schedule recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), the general assumption is that the safety of giving infants and children 49 doses of 14 vaccines between day of birth and age six has been thoroughly researched and proven safe. Many parents (and perhaps many pediatricians) would be surprised to learn there are a number of important unanswered questions about the number of vaccines, timing, the order and the ages at which recommended vaccines are given to babies and young children.The CDC sets the childhood vaccine schedule based on the recommendations from a small group of medical doctors appointed by the CDC to the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP).The AAP and the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) also evaluate and routinely endorse the CDCs childhood vaccine schedule.1According to the CDC, before a vaccine is officially included in the schedule, the ACIP reviews the evidence for safety and effectiveness for each vaccine when given to infants and children at specific ages, the severity of the disease and how many children would get the disease if there was no vaccine, and also how well the vaccine works for children of various ages.1The CDC currently recommends that multiple doses of vaccines be given to all children under age six on a specific schedule to prevent 14 potentially serious infectious diseases.1Regarding use of alternative vaccine schedules to delay or give fewer vaccines on one day, the CDC states:The AAP leadership has strongly endorsed the CDCs position opposing use of alternative vaccine schedules and notes:According to the AAP, each vaccine dose is scheduled at certain times based on two factors the age at which the bodys immune system will work the best and the need to provide protection to children as early as possible.2Addressing parental concerns that too many vaccines are being given together too soon and too often, which can compromise immune and brain function, both CDC and AAP officials insist that vaccines are well studied to make sure it is safe for an infant or young child to be given dozens of doses of vaccines throughout childhood and six to 10 different vaccines at once.3 CDC officials maintain there is scientific data proving there is no danger in giving a baby multiple vaccines simultaneously and the practice does not cause any chronic health problems. The CDC website states:4However, a report released by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) in 2013,The Childhood Immunization Schedule and Safety: Stakeholder Concerns, Scientific Evidence and Future Studies, contradicts the firm position that the CDC, AAP and AAFP hold with respect to the safety of the schedule.5In response to continuing public questions and concerns, the report was published after an IOM committee conducted a comprehensive review of the medical literature to identify studies related to the safety of the recommended vaccine schedule for infants and children under six years old.5The IOM Committee was only able to identify fewer than 40 scientific studies published since 2003 and clearly stated in the report that there are significant gaps in scientific knowledge about the safety of the early childhood vaccine schedule:First, the concept of the immunization schedule is not well developed in the scientific literature. Most vaccine research focuses on the health outcomes associated with single immunizations or combinations of vaccines administered at a single visit. Even though each new vaccine is evaluated in the context of the overall immunization schedule that existed at the time of review, individual elements of the schedule are not evaluated once it is adjusted to accommodate a new vaccine. Key elements of the immunization schedulefor example, the number, frequency, timing, order, and age at the time of administration of vaccineshave not been systematically examined in research studies.5Frequently citing a lack of enough quality scientific studies, the IOM committee was unable to determine whether the numbers of doses and timing of CDC recommended vaccines children receive in the first six years of life areor are notassociated with health problems in premature infants or the development of chronic brain and immune system disorders in children, including asthma, atopy, allergy, autoimmunity, autism, learning disorders, communication disorders, developmental disorders, intellectual disability, attention deficit disorder, disruptive behavior disorder, tics and Tourettes syndrome, seizures, febrile seizures and epilepsy.The IOM Committee also discovered that there is very limited information about subpopulations of vulnerable children, who may be biologically at greater risk for suffering vaccine injury and death.Additionally, the IOM report acknowledged that vaccine safety is not a high enough priority for federal health officials making vaccine use recommendations and goes on to say:When the IOM report was released in 2013, the National Vaccine Information Center (NVIC) issued a statement calling for transparency, independence and replication in future research to assess the safety of federal vaccine policies, including evaluating health outcomes of vaccinated and unvaccinated children and those using alternative vaccine schedules.6NVIC also pointed out that there have been no studies comparing the differences in health outcomes between entirely unvaccinated populations of children and those receiving all government recommended vaccines on schedule.Parents have good reason to question the CDCs childhood vaccine schedule when there is so little scientific evidence demonstrating safety being provided to the public. The lack of core science to support expansion of the childhood vaccine schedule is concerning because many states are in the process of mandating every CDC recommended vaccine for daycare and school attendance. If credible scientific studies and systematic reviews proving the long term safety of giving children 49 doses of 14 vaccines before age six do in fact exist, the CDC should make them immediately available to the public.
