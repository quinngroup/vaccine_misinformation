It causes a major burden of severe lower respiratory tract disease in children under 5yrs of age with an estimated 3,000,000 hospital episodes annually in all countries [1]. The vast majority of this burden occurs in low income countries [1]. The age distribution of childhood severe disease is highly skewed towards young infants (<6m), with around 50% of all RSV associated hospitalisations in this age group, attributed to small airway blockage through inflammation and sloughing of infected epithelial cells [2]. Early vaccine development, focused on this vulnerable group resulted in disaster when a formalin-inactivated preparation administered to nave children led to exacerbated pneumonia and mortality upon natural RSV challenge [3]. Over the subsequent five decades, vaccination research for young infants has centred on live attenuated virus candidates (e.g. [4, 5]), but progress has been compromised by the presence of maternally derived antibodies (MAb), immunological immaturity, vaccine intolerance [3], and the legacy of uncertainty from the early vaccine failure. Currently, there is a growth of interest in RSV vaccine development due to technical advances in delivery modalities, with around 45 candidates in various pre-clinical and clinical stages [6]. At the same time, there is recognition of the need to consider other groups to vaccinate to reduce the burden of infant disease. Older children aged 6 to 24 months are one of these groupsthey have the advantage of a more mature immune system, lower levels of interfering maternal antibody and greater tolerance [7]. Live attenuated virus vaccines (LAV) administered intranasally to seronegative children of this age have been shown to be both immunogenic and well tolerated e.g. [4, 5]. Importantly they are also shown not to predispose the child to enhanced disease following wild type exposure, and, although the trials are small in size, indicated protective efficacy [8]. There is an active clinical trial program for LAV candidates for the prevention of RSV associated lower respiratory tract infection in young children [6, 9, 10]. The potential impact of vaccination of older children (including groups such as elder siblings) will depend upon the degree of direct and indirect protection due to the intervention. There are clear direct benefits to be gained from vaccinating older children since a significant proportion of RSV severe disease occurs beyond the first 6 months of life [11]. However, the main emphasis remains the prevention of disease in early infancy, which would have to accrue from indirect protection (often called herd immunity). Manufacturers and funding agencies would be encouraged if it were to be shown that vaccinating older infants offered an additional indirect protection to the young infant. To what extent older age group vaccination will confer herd immunity to the vulnerable young infant is unclear [12, 13]. This forms the subject of this paper. Analysis of a cohort study in Kenya has demonstrated that the severe risk in young children is principally associated with age at infection, not their lack of experience of infection [14]. Studies of transmission in households have shown that at least half of transmission to infants is due to infection introduced to the household by their older siblings [15, 16]. Both of these results support the idea that immunisation of older children against RSV could be used to reduce disease in infants by delaying primary infection until they are older. Vaccination provides both direct protection to those who are successfully immunized with the vaccine and indirect protection for those who are not immunized by decreasing the number of the infectious individuals. Therefore, the impact of immunisation of children on infection and disease in infants is largely determined by the rate at which infection is transferred between different risk or age groups [1719]. Consequently, we explore two different, data-based formulations of the age-related contact matrix, and also perform a parameter sensitivity analysis. Our aim is to comprehensively explore the impact of childhood immunisation on RSV infection and morbidity, in the developing country setting, using mathematical predictive models paying particular attention to the pattern of mixing between age groups. What is the impact of vaccination of older infants and children on the public health burden of RSV in young infants?We have presented an analysis of a mathematical model describing the transmission dynamics of RSV using data from a low-income country setting and explored both the long-term and the short-term impact of introducing RSV immunisation with two mixing assumptions. The outcome of fitting the model with different mixing assumptions gives results that are indistinguishable in terms of model fit and broadly consistent results in terms of the impact of immunisation. However, the results differ in a number of respects. First, there is a narrower range for the optimum age for the synthetic matrix, and the predicted impact is generally lower. Second, the two matrices are associated with very different underlying seasonal patterns of transmission. In fact the seasonal forcing that explains the observed epidemic pattern of RSV depends heavily on the details of the WAIFW. This is to be expected, and something worth exploring in more detail. If children are the core group for RSV as they are for measles [36], then presumably contact patterns are seasonally forced by the school year pattern, which is known, and would provide indirect information on the WAIFW matrix. Because the fitted dynamics of infection vary considerably depending on the WAIFW structure, but the optimum age window is unchanged, we suggest that this result will hold for most other epidemiological settings. Consideration of the impact of demographics and mixing in other settings remain to be explored. From Fig 3, it is clear that vaccination is potentially effective if given after maternal immunity is lost and before individuals have been infected for the first time. This is a restatement of the window problem first recognized for measles in high transmission settings [35], but with the extension that for RSV all settings are essentially high transmission because people are often reinfected [14, 15, 22, 37]. Further explanation for the impact of such immunisation is portrayed in Fig 4, which shows that immunisation works rapidly and effectively to reduce hospitalisation since severe disease is highly age-dependent (see Table A in S1 File). However, the dynamic patterns predicted for the mixing matrices are different. The WAIFW matrix derived from contact diaries predicts an initial dramatic decline in cases as virus circulation is almost stopped for the first few epidemic seasons. As with other infections, this results in a build-up of susceptibles and a subsequent rebound of epidemics [35]. Although virus circulation returns in older age groups, the immunisation programme prevents a return to pre-vaccination levels of disease. The WAIFW matrix derived synthetically allows virus transmission to be maintained and precludes a rebound effect. Given that viral circulation is not predicted to be greatly curtailed, there is very little possibility of adverse consequences of immunisation, for example caused by increased susceptibility in adults. The two mixing matrices also predict two different mechanisms for vaccination effectiveness. Using the diary matrix, the model is essentially a susceptible-infected-resistant (SIR) framework in which primary cases drive the transmission and re-infections are followers, i.e. if the primary cases are reduced, then circulation is suppressed. Vaccination results in a dramatically increased average age at first infection (Fig 4E), effectively reducing the risk of infants becoming infected during the most susceptible ages. Using the synthetic matrix, reinfections are more important sources of transmission, so that transmission continues in the face of vaccination. Contact patterns are dominated by children (compare Fig 4C and 4D), so the indirect protection comes from preventing the young infecting the very young, i.e. it is more dependent on the exact contact pattern between the youngest age groups. Vaccination is predicted to delay, rather than prevent, primary infection, so that the increase in average age at primary infection is relatively small, but has a large impact. The estimate of viral transmissibility (as measured by the basic reproduction number) using the diary approach is below that using the synthetic matrix, and the two models (same structure, different parameters) fall either side of the re-infection threshold [37, 38]. For the diary matrix, RSV is unable to persist on secondary and tertiary infections alone, whereas the synthetic matrix model does not require primary infections to persist. Note the relative infectiousness of the different stages is fixed, but the overall infectiousness is estimated given the different mixing structures. This yields very different estimates for the basic reproduction numbers for the two models, even though they fit the data equally well prior to vaccination. These observations make our vaccination results doubly robust: either primary cases are the drivers of RSV and transmission is greatly reduced, or primary cases are less important but vaccination reduces the source of transmission to the most vulnerable age groups. In either case we are predicting a substantial benefit from vaccination, with 5070% of reduction in hospitalisation due to indirect protection. The uncertainty and sensitivity results demonstrate that there is considerable variability in the potential effectiveness of a vaccination programme when both parameter and structural uncertainty are included. Given available information, the impact of 70% coverage could be to reduce hospitalisations by any value between 10% and 90%, although the best median values are >60%. However, the age of optimum immunisation is robust to these uncertainties. Whether the objective is to maximise the chances of a very successful intervention (>80% reduction in hospitalisation), reduce the chances of a poor intervention (<40% reduction) or maximise the expected outcome, the age window remains 5m to 10m. The correlation between model outcomes and unknown parameters shows that the two models differ in their sensitivity. The diary matrix model emphasizes infection transmission between younger age groups (i.e. infants infected from primary infections), whereas the synthetic matrix emphasizes infection from older individuals (i.e. from secondary and subsequent infections to infants). Our focus has been on the impact of vaccination, but we have also demonstrated that the prediction of infection dynamics and consequent impact of immune responses to infection depends critically on the mixing assumptions. Recent results have also demonstrated the importance of demographic processes (especially birth rate) [39], and environmental (atmospheric) conditions [40] in determining RSV transmission dynamics. Recent individual-based models including explicit household and school-based transmission comes to a similar conclusion to our own [41]. Similarly, the impact of vaccination has been shown to be beneficial in much simpler models (e.g. [42]). Clearly, the impact of vaccination needs to be assessed in a wide variety of models including these and other processes such as viral genetics [34], but no model has yet suggested that immunisation against RSV would not be beneficial. Immunisation is an extremely effective tool for preventing infection in individuals, but also results in protection of those not immunised through herd immunity. Careful consideration of the effects of herd immunity often changes the optimum allocation of vaccine [4345]. Our results indicate that immunisation of young children (510m) is likely to be a highly effective method of prevention of severe RSV disease which arises predominately from infection in infants <6m old. The majority benefit is derived from herd immunity. We are greatly reassured that the different WAIFW, seasonality and reinfection threshold parameters can be combined to give the same endemic pattern and predict a similar public health benefit to vaccination. Given the scarcity of contact data in different populations and the costly nature and difficulty of acquiring such data, we have developed a computational approach to derive the mixing pattern of the KHDSS population from household contacts combined with assumptions about school and out-of-school mixing pattern. This kind of approach has been independently developed for a number of European countries [46] with a notable agreement between the synthetic and the contact diary mixing data generated from the POLYMOD study [47]. The main advantage with this method is that it is general and can be easily used for regions without contact survey data as well as reconstruction of historical contact patterns for evaluation of the effect of demographic transition. The vaccine modelled here only protects against primary infection. Importantly, this assumes that, as with primary infection, vaccination is followed by a transient period of protection and subsequent reduced susceptibility to reinfection and reduced infectiousness and duration upon reinfection. Although this is the most likely scenario for LAV since boosting of titres is absent in seropositives [4], reversion to a completely nave susceptible state following waning vaccine immunity (or indeed natural infection immunity) cannot be ruled out [34]. Given that our results are dependent on reduction in disease rather than infection, a vaccine that reduces infectiousness of secondary and subsequent infections would have no less impact, but may be higher. Additionally, this work provides a conservative estimate of the impact of vaccination in assuming that the vaccine acts only on nave individuals i.e. not previously infected. This would be the situation for a highly attenuated live virus vaccine that would not boost antibody in seropositive susceptibles. We argue that RSV vaccine in 510m old children would result in significant herd immunity and lead to marked reduction in disease in those <6 months old. There are a group of vaccines that have already been subject to extensive trials and have relatively few obstacles remaining to develop an effective licensed product. We therefore propose that promotion of these candidates could have clear global public health benefit.
