One of the first questions I am almost always asked when I tell people I teach classes on how vaccinations affect childrens immune system and the choices parents have concerning vaccinations is, Dont kids needs their shots to go to school?Parents are told that vaccinations are required for school, which is an understandable assumption, for the Minnesota Department of Health uses the terminology required immunizations. This assumption is further substantiated by slogan No Shots, No School whichhas been usedby Park Nicollet as part of their immunization initiative.So are vaccinations required for school or not?Well, yesand nodepending on ones intellectual honesty.Park Nicollets No Shots, No School Immunization Initiative states, Minnesota law requires immunizations, or written proof of exemption, for school age children to attend school.This statement is true, and is in exact accordance with Minnesotas Statues on Immunizations.Where the problem lies in stating that vaccinations are required, even though it is stated that there are exemptions, is what the exemptions in themselves really are.The Minnesota Statutes on Immunizations states in Subdivision 3(d):If a notarized statement signed by the minor child's parent or guardian or by the emancipated person is submitted to the administrator or other person having general control and supervision of the school or child care facility stating that the person has not been immunized as prescribed in subdivision 1 because of the conscientiously held beliefs of the parent or guardian of the minor child or of the emancipated person, the immunizations specified in the statement shall not be required. This statement must also be forwarded to the commissioner of the Department of Health.This, one of seven exemptions listed in the statues, states in legalese that if a child has not been immunized because the parents believe that they shouldnt have the shots, the shots arent required.In other words, the shots arent required unless the parents want their child to have them.Now according to the Minnesota Statues on Immunizations, what is required is that it is documented whether or not a child has received the required immunizations, or whether the parents have chosen one of the exemptions.However, this requirement is a far cry from what is implied what is required through the No Shots, No School program.What it boils down to is that immunizations for children entering school are recommended, but .Is this perhaps just a differing opinion of the terminology that is used? Whats the big deal?The big deal is that through using the term required, even though anyone can be exempt, is that it has created the false public understanding that vaccinations are required for school entry.So why would health officials deliberately make people think that their children have to have their shots to go to school, when its not true?It is hard to convince the public that something is good.Consequently, the best way to push forward a new program is to decide on what you think the best decision is and not question it thereafter, and further, not to raise questions before the public or expose the public to open discussion of the issues.- Dr. Paul Meier in a panel discussion on the efficacy of the polio vaccine campaign of the 1950s during the Intensive Immunization Program Hearings, 1962If you choose for your child to receive none or only some of the required vaccinations, the exemption forms can be found at the Minnesota Department of Health website:You will notice that if you decide to make a conscientious decision not to vaccinate the department of health takes one more attempt to scare or guilt you out of your choice:I understand that not following vaccination recommendations may endanger the health or life of my child and others that my child might come in contact with.This statement is completely unfounded and simply a scare tactic to get those who go against the departments recommendation to comply with their program.Please understand this statement for what it is, and thankfully your decision can be based on careful study of the issue and not simply following propaganda.If you would like to find more information
