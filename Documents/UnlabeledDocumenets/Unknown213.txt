Vaccines are highly regulated, complex biologics. They are made from weak or dead versions of the viruses or bacteria that cause disease. Vaccines stimulate the immune system so that it thinks it is being attacked by an active virus or bacteria. Your body responds by producing antibodies that remain in your system for future protection.An adjuvant is a substance added to a vaccine to enhance the immune systems response. Adjuvants used today make it possible to reduce the amount of antigens (weak or dead viruses or bacteria) in a vaccine. The only adjuvants used in vaccines in Canada are aluminum salts (aluminum hydroxide, aluminum phosphate, or potassium aluminum sulfate). Monitoring of vaccines over seven decades has proven adjuvants are safe.Additives may be added to a vaccine to ensure it is kept pure and stable. Thimerosal, for example, is a preservative used in tiny amounts in multi-dose vials of influenza vaccines.Note: Thimerosal is not used in pediatric vaccines routinely used in Canada, with the exception of the influenza vaccine.Trace (or barely detectable) amounts of substances used to grow and then inactivate viruses in the early manufacturing steps, may be found in vaccines.No vaccine contains animal or human cells, or human blood or serum.For a complete list of types and contents of vaccines approved for use in Canada see the Canadian Immunization Guide (external link).The composition of each vaccine is unique.Product monographs (descriptions) are available from vaccine manufacturers.
