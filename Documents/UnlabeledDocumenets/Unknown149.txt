Vaccines are created with a long list of ingredients. These ingredients can often have potent side effects, both alone and in combination.* This is a partial ingredient list with information from Vaccine Excipient & Media Summary, Part 2, Excipients included in U.S. Vaccines, by Vaccine. The information was accessed in November 2008 from: www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/appendices/B/excipient-table-2.pdf** This list contains a combination of many adverse post-vaccination occurrences, and possible occurrences, that have been published in the manufacturers own documents. Any use of [brackets] is information added by Generation Rescue. This list may not contain all adverse occurrences; it may contain typographical errors, and it does not take the place of reading the manufacturers most current documents in their entirety.
