Anti-vaccine concerns are particularly prevalent with the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine, because it contains three live and weakened viruses. As one parent put it to Vox's Julia Belluz, "Their immune system won't encounter those naturally."This concern has led some parents to avoid the MMR vaccine, making it more likely that dangerous, contagious diseases like measles will spread.But there's no evidence the MMR vaccine poses an extra risk. A 2011 review of the research by the Institute of Medicine found no serious side-effects caused by the MMR vaccine for people with healthy immune systems.Tom Shimabukuro, deputy director of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's immunization safety office, said the MMR vaccine doesn't cause any more adverse effects than other vaccines. According to CDC data, fevers after the MMR vaccine occur in one out of six people, and mild rashes in one in 20. More severe problems are virtually nonexistent: serious allergic reactions happen in less than one in a million cases. Deafness, long-term seizures, and permanent brain damage are "so rare that it is hard to tell whether they are caused by the vaccine."While it might seem sensible to worry about a vaccine that includes several (weakened) viruses, the reality is these incapacitated pathogens are much weaker than what babies face on a regular basis and denying vaccination against these diseases only makes it more likely that children will have to deal with the full versions of these viruses, which are truly dangerous and deadly.
