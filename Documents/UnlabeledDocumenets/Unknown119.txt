This vaccine is also known as the Da2PPV vaccine, and provides dogs with protection against canine distemper, adenovirus/heptatitis, parvovirus and parainfluenza. This is the vaccine that is most commonly referred to as the puppy shot. Recent studies have shown that its not the number of vaccines that a puppy receives, but the age at which the last shot is given that will determine how protected that dog is against the diseases the vaccine combats.Puppies should get their first Distemper/Parvo shot between 6 and 8 weeks old. They will need a booster vaccine every three to four weeks until they get their last shot at between 4 and 4 months old. If puppies are older than 8 weeks but younger than four months when they start their series, they will need to continue getting vaccines every three to four weeks until they are four or four and a half months old. Depending on the size of your puppy when they are four months old, the veterinarian may recommend an additional distemper/parvo vaccine three to four weeks later. This is because Parvo is a very serious virus, and can be incredibly fatal in smaller dogs.Older dogs (older than four months old), who have never been vaccinated will receive two Distemper/Parvo shots, three to four weeks apart before they should be considered protected.All dogs should have this vaccine boostered yearly, unless otherwise directed by the Veterinarian.
