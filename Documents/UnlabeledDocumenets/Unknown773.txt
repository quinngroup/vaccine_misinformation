Profit-hungry drug companies and vets are 'frightening' dog owners into inoculating their pets more often than necessary, according to U.K. based pet charity, Canine Health Concern.Some puppies have developed conditions including autism and epilepsy after a raft of injections, it warns.Catherine O'Driscoll, from the charity, said: We are not anti-vaccination. What we are saying is that currently our pets are receiving far too many. The latest scientific research shows that after the first course of injections as a puppy most dogs are immune against these diseases for at least seven years, if not for life.Canine Health Concern maintains that some puppies and dogs have suffered dramatic changes in behavior or been diagnosed with cancer within months of receiving vaccine injections.In a letter backed by 17 vets and other pet experts, the charity has called on the Veterinary Medicines Directorate, which monitors animal vaccines, to issue new advice on their use.
