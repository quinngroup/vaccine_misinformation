Since all the controversy regarding vaccines has come up and people have stopped or changed how they vaccinate their children, there has been a resurgence of the diseases that previously had almost disappeared from the U.S.In 2007 and 2008, there continues to be a measles outbreak in San Diego, Arizona, New York, Michigan, and WisconsinIn 2006, there was a huge outbreak of mumps in the Midwest of more than 5000 cases. In recent years there have been >15,000 cases in England.More than 17 large studies have shown no link between MMR and autism.The authors of the original study that claimed the link in the first place have since published a retraction stating that their study was not conclusive.In 1993, Japan stopped giving the MMR combined and gave separate mumps, measles and rubellaIt made no difference, and their incidence of autism has continued to be on the rise.All of our routine vaccines are mercury-free? Only the flu shot has very small amounts.A Tuna sandwich has 5 times more mercury than 1 dose of flu vaccine.A breastfed baby gets 25 times more mercury from breast milk in 6 months than what is in 1 dose of flu vaccine.The type of mercury found in vaccines is not the kind that has been shown to be an issue. The type that has been shown to cause problems is called Methyl mercury. This is NOT the type of mercury in vaccines which is called Ethyl mercury. Ethyl mercury in vaccines is a larger molecule that cannot cross the blood-brain barrier to enter the brain.
