Vaccine efficacy refers to the ability of a vaccine to bring about the intended beneficial effects on vaccinated individuals in a defined population under ideal conditions of use. The potential benefits of an effective vaccine e.g. promotion of health and well-being, and protection from illness and its physical, psychological and socioeconomic consequences must be weighed against the potential risk of an adverse event following immunization (AEFI) with that vaccine. Vaccine-associated risk is the probability of an adverse or unwanted outcome occurring, and the severity of the resulting harm to the health of vaccinated individuals in a defined population following immunization with a vaccine under ideal conditions of use.Public confidence in vaccine safety is increased by clear communication of risk/benefit assessments, comparing the very low vaccine-associated risk with the very significant benefits of vaccination.An important criterion of vaccine safety that regulatory authorities must establish is the risk/benefit assessment of immunization with a particular vaccine in a defined population. You will learn how to conduct a risk/benefit assessment in Module 4 'Surveillance' and about the actions that follow the identification of an increased or new vaccine risk. Here we introduce you to some basic principles and the issues that regulatory authorities consider when balancing vaccine efficacy and vaccine safety.Risk evaluation for a specific vaccine requires the collection and analysis of reliable data on:
