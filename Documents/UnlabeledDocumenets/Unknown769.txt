There is no shortage of research regarding the negative effects of a wide variety of vaccines. From Gardasil to the seasonal flu shot, studies have proven that the extreme risks associated with vaccinating oftentimes outweigh the minor benefits. Here is a fraction of the research (over 100 studies) tying vaccines to a host of health conditions, broken down by category:Vaccines and Immunization References and Research Citations; Vaccines Have Been Linked to Leukemias and Lymphomas:Stewart, AM, et al, Aetiology of Childhood Leukaemia, Lancet, 16 Oct, 1965, 2:789-790.

Coulter described that central nervous system damage can be exhibited as abnormal behavior of the child. In 1935, Thomas Rivers, experimental allergic encephalitis (EAE) can be the result of a viral or bacterial infection of the nervous system. The fact of the matter is that it is a matter of record that it was known that vaccination produced encephalitis since 1926. The authors stated, In regions in which there is no organized vaccination of the population, general paralysis is rare. It is impossible to deny a connection between vaccinations and the encephalitis (brain damage) which follows it. Vaccines have been linked to seizures, convulsions and epilepsy.
