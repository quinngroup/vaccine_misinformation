The physicians and staff at Austin Regional Clinic support immunizations. Austin Regional Clinic pediatricians and family medicine physicians agree that our physicians will not accept any new patients to our practice who do not vaccinate. Our primary concern is the safety of all our patients. We encourage our current families with unvaccinated children to talk about immunization concerns and to begin the catch-up schedule to begin your childs vaccinations.Medical experts agree that the development of immunizations was one of the most significant medical advancements of the 20th century. Today, thanks to the development and widespread use of vaccines, the frequency of these illnesses has been vastly reduced, and in some cases almost eliminated. Unfortunately many parents are confused about the value and safety of vaccines due to misinformation. If you have any questions about vaccine safety, please discuss your concerns with your childs doctor. Parents who choose not to immunize their children place their children and the people around their children at risk of serious illnesses. We do not want to place the rest of our patients at risk of contracting vaccine-preventable illnesses.Below you will find the pediatric immunization schedule and web sites that offer information about immunizations at all ages.Please call you pediatrician to make appointments or for any questions.
