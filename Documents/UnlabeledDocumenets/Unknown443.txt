Vaccine injuries are relatively rare. But when they occur, they can be very real, sometimes devastating, and occasionally fatal.Some vaccine injuries are obvious and easy to prove. Others are far less apparent, making it much more difficult to prove actual cause and obtain needed compensation.An example of obvious injury is paralysis caused by polio from an oral polio vaccination (OPV), which uses a live vaccine. Due to high risk of injury, oral polio vaccinations are no longer used in the USA.Another problem: Your pediatrician may not admit to you that your child has a vaccination injury. This sometimes happens when it was the pediatrician who administered the vaccine, and he wants to protect his reputation rather than provide you with an accurate evaluation or the truth.Certain types of injuries can be caused by almost any vaccine. The injury might be directly related to the immunizing agent itself, or it might be in reaction to other ingredients or factors in the overall vaccine product.On the other hand, vaccines for certain diseases tend to cause specific injuries, as in the case of oral polio vaccine previously mentioned. Another example: DPT vaccines can sometimes cause toxic encephalopathy where endotoxin and the pertussis antigen (whooping cough), both of which are toxic, can cause brain injury and seizures.Because different people react to vaccinations in different ways and to different degrees, the extent and seriousness of vaccine injuries can vary widely. Injuries can range from minor symptoms that heal in short order with few or no long-term effects to injuries resulting in life-long disabilities, or even death.Also, sometimes injuries can be exacerbated by doctors and nurses who "follow rules" rather than using careful judgment. Or they might jump to an incorrect conclusion if they encounter a rare or certain kind of injury or vaccine-related disorder they aren't familiar with or haven't learned about.Correctly spotting and diagnosing vaccine-related problems can be especially difficult when the causal relationship between symptoms and a recent vaccination may not be obvious, and therefore quite difficult to discover.But whether due to human errors rooted in carelessness, inattentiveness, fatigue, or being rushed for time or simply natural adverse reactions to a vaccination by the patient vaccine injuries can be of monumental consequence for the victim and those who become responsible for that person's care perhaps for many years.Much has been learned by comparing:In many cases those conditions and reactions are rather similar.Analysis of case reports, epidemiology, and additional research on animals and humans provides insights into vaccines and different kinds of related injuries.Discoveries show that vaccine injuries, though rarer, are often similar to injuries and conditions caused by the disease being vaccinated against. Most of the adverse reactions that end up being considered by the Vaccine-Injury Compensation Program (VICP or NVICP) tend to be rare reactions directly related to a specific vaccine or its related disease.As this knowledge-base increases, it is becoming increasingly useful for evaluating and processing VICP injury claims.The National Vaccine Injury Program requires that you show a medical connection between the vaccination and the claimed injury. That means you must:When the person making the claim meets these three requirements, the burden of proof then shifts to the government attorney who must then show that some other cause is more likely than the one presented in the claim.Obviously, given the complexity of medical issues and human imperfections, filing and supporting a claim for vaccine-injury compensation is no job for amateurs.That's why the NVICP provides for direct payment of attorneys' fees and expenses related to handling vaccine-injury cases so you don't have to be concerned about the cost of representation.When the NVICP approves and pays compensation, the entire amount is given to the victim or the person responsible for the victim's care. No funds are retained to pay for attorneys' costs and fees.The best and safest way to make sure your rights under the NVICP are properly presented and protected is to be certain you're represented by qualified, experienced, legal counsel.You have the finest representation available when you trust your claim to Richard Gage and Associates.
