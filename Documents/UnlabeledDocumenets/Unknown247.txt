A study based on anonymous email surveys of mothers who homeschool their children that suggested a correlation between vaccines and autism was published online on November 21st, 2016 in the journal Frontiers in Public Health. On November 28th, that article (titled Vaccination and Health Outcomes: A Survey of 6- to 12-year-old Vaccinated and Unvaccinated Children based on Mothers Reports) was removed and deleted after the journal faced widespread criticism of its methods and motives.The only statement released by Frontiers in Public Health was this brief Twitter reply to critics, which claimed that the paper had been only provisionally accepted despite appearing in a finalized form online:The fact that a study alleging a link between autism and vaccines a decades-long controversy with no mainstream scientific support and whose origins are rooted in another retracted and unethical study was taken down at all has led some anti-vaccine groups to imply some sort of nefarious plot to hide the truth from the public.This particular study, however, was fatally flawed on three levels: it was problematic in its design; the authors had a clear agenda combined with a financial conflict of interest; and the journal that published it is widely considered to be predatory, with a track record of publishing deeply flawed, controversial, and biased research with limited or sloppy peer-review.First a look at the studys design, as captured by a screenshot of its abstract before the page was removed:Homeschool organizations in four states (Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Oregon) were asked to forward an email to their members, requesting mothers to complete an anonymous online questionnaire on the vaccination status and health outcomes of their biological children ages 6 to 12. [] A total of 415 mothers provided data on 666 children, of which 261 (39%) were unvaccinated. Vaccinated children were significantly less likely than the unvaccinated to have been diagnosed with chickenpox and pertussis, but significantly more likely to have been diagnosed with pneumonia, otitis media, allergies and NDDs (defined as Autism Spectrum Disorder, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, and/or a learning disability).As ScienceBlogs David Gorski noted on his blog Respectful Insolence, the population selected for the study is far from a representative sample (its a homeschool population from only four states), and 666 individuals are nowhere near enough participants from which to draw any sort of significant conclusion:Another critique of its methods is the fact that the study grouped autism with a series of other neurodevelopmental disorders (which includedAttention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and any other learning disability) without making a distinction between these very different conditions in their results.As bloggers and internet sleuths uncovered, this study appears to have been financially supported by individuals with an anti-vaccine agenda. A November 2012 post on the anti-vaccine blog Age of Autism promoted a study concept identical to the retracted study and which was to be carried out by the same research institution.That post encouraged readers to donate to Jenny McCarthys anti-vaccine charity Generation Rescue (the post itself was written by J. B. Handey, the co-founder of that charity) and assured readers that 100% of the money would go to the study, which it claimed was short by around 400,000 dollars:In order to finish the work and see the first documented data comparing vaccinated and unvaccinated children, an additional $400,000 needs to be raised. [] If you can help, please donate directly through the Generation Rescue website, HERE.In addition, over and above conflicts of interest in funding, Anthony Mawson the studys lead author and a visiting professor at Jackson State University has long been a vocal proponent of the link between Autism and Vaccines. In 2007 he allegedly (according to archived webpages) wrote a letter arguing against the retraction of Andrew Wakefields 1998 paper that originally proposed that link a position well outside the mainstream scientific consensus. He also alleged in a 2011lawsuit (later dismissed) that he lost his job due to his views on vaccine safety.Finally, the journal Frontiers in Public Health, and indeed the entire Frontiers series of journals, have exercised dubious judgement in their editorial decisions. Some reporters consider the journal to be overtly predatory enticing fringe research with lax peer review and a pay-to-play business model.As reported by Retraction Watch in July 2016, Frontiers in Public Health published and then retracted a study on chemtrails the longstanding conspiracy theory about the dangers of cloud trails released from jet planes. In one of its more infamous episodes, Frontiers in Public Health published an article that questioned the link between HIV and AIDS, titled Questioning the HIV-AIDS hypothesis: 30 years of dissent. In response to the criticism of this controversial paper, the editors solution was to reclassify the paper from an original research paper to an opinion paper.It does not appear that the peer review process was well run in this recent vaccine study either. One of the two people who peer reviewed the study was actually a chiropractor named Linda Mullin Elkins with no published research on the subject of autism or any background in vaccine research.Frontiers in Public Health has yet to issue a formal retraction as the studys review has been reopened. It is hard to see, though, how a poorly designed, limited-population study based solely on an anonymous email survey funded by organizations or individuals with an agenda, published in a journal that allows a chiropractor to review a study about the health risks of vaccines, could pass any reasonable definition of publishable.
