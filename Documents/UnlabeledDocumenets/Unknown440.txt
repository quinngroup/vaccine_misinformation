This webpage provides information on how to file a vaccine injury claim, links and resources on vaccine injury compensation to aid those who believe that they have suffered a vaccine injury and to raise awareness of the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program.NVIC's co-founders worked with Congress on the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986, which acknowledged that vaccine injuries and deaths are real and that the vaccine injured and their families should be financially supported and that vaccine safety protections were needed in the mass vaccination system.The law preserved the right for vaccine injured persons to bring a lawsuit in the court system if federal compensation is denied or is not sufficient. By 2010, the U.S. Court of Claims had awarded nearly $3 billion dollars to vaccine victims for their catastrophic vaccine injuries, although two out of three applicants have been denied compensation.We invite you to use the links below to understand the law, injury claims process and more.
