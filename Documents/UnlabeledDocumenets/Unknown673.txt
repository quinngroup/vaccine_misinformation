The CDC has issued a comprehensive guide of recommended best practices to VFC participants on the storage and handling of vaccines. States such as California will begin to require VFC participants to follow the CDC guidelines starting in 2017. Refrigerated vaccines need to be maintained at temperatures between 2 and 8 C (36 and 46 F), and vaccines stored in a freezer need to be maintained at between -50 and -15 C (-58 and +5 F). To guard against vaccine spoilage, the CDC recommends continuous monitoring technology to detect, alert and record temperature excursions of stored vaccines.Awarepoint offers a temperature monitoring system that enables medical facilities to maintain compliance to CDC recommendations and ensure that vaccines are stored at the appropriate temperature. The Awarepoint solution continuously monitors vaccine storage temperature, provides temperature logging software and immediately alerts staff members via audible tone, text and email when temperature excursions begin. The ability to take immediate corrective action minimizes the chance of vaccine spoilage.In addition to eliminating the need for manual temperature logging, which is often unreliable, inaccurate and misplaced, the Awarepoint system can generate a variety of useful reports on all of your VFC and environmental storage units. Documentation and reports are securely stored on Awarepoints cloud and enterprise users have access to historical data and reports. Awarepoints wireless temperature monitoring devices can store readings, so data history stays intact, local audible alerts remain active, even during network disruptions.Continuously monitors and records temperature data for each VFC storage unitTriggers automatic text/email alerts to staff when storage temperature goes out of rangeDigital door-mounted temperature display issues an audible alert to staff in the vicinity to take corrective actionStores up to 96 hours of data in the event of a network outage and automatically uploads the stored data once network connectivity is restoredMakes available multiple downloadable reports, including temperature history, out of range events and regulatory reports2 year battery lifeCovers a broad range of temperatures from -55C to 100CNIST-certified VFC compliant calibrated probeCentrally managed via Wi-Fi, with over-the-air firmware and configuration updates
