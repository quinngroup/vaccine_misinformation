Students who intern in the Vaccine Injury Litigation Clinic will have the opportunity to work with us in representing children and adults who are injured by vaccines. Vaccine injury practice is a fascinating and challenging area of federal litigation involving complex medical causation issues, scientific research (typically in areas such as immunology, neurology, and genetics), medical experts, and, often-times, detailed damages calculations. The Vaccine Injury Litigation Clinic represents clients from all over the country. The defendant in vaccine injury cases is the United States government, which is represented by a special unit of Department of Justice Lawyers in Washington, D.C., where the Court itself is physically located. The clinic also handles other cases involving Social Security disability benefits, long term disability benefits, and medical device product liability cases.
