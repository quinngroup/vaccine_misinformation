Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a virus spread through sexual contact. HPV is so common; almost everyone will be infected with the virus at some point in their lives. HPV can be passed even when an infected person has no signs or symptoms. In most cases, HPV goes away on its own and people infected with the virus never knew they had it. However, when HPV does not go away, it can cause health problems such as genital warts and cancer. Cancer often takes years to develop after a person is infected with HPV. The best way to prevent the most common types of HPV is to receive the 3-dose series of HPV vaccine. HPV vaccine is CANCER PREVENTION!
