The Vaccines for Children (VFC) Program helps provide vaccines to all West Virginia children whose parents or guardians may not be able to afford them. This helps ensure that all children have a better chance of getting their recommended vaccinations on schedule. These vaccines protect babies, young children, and adolescents from 16 diseases. Vaccines available through the VFC Program are those recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) and approved by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Your child is eligible for the VFC Program if he or she is younger than 19 years of age and is one of the following: Medicaid-eligible, Uninsured, Underinsured, American Indian or Alaska Native. Underinsured means your child has health insurance, but it does notcover vaccines, or doesnotcover certain vaccines, or covers vaccines but has a fixed dollar limit or cap for vaccines. Once that fixed dollar amount is reached, your child is then eligible. Underinsured children are eligible to receive vaccines only at Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHC) or Rural Health Clinics (RHC). FQHCsare a type of provider that meets certain criteria under Medicare and Medicaid programs. All West Virginia health departmentsparticipate in the VFC program.
