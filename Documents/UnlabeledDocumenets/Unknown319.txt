TCAP offers low cost vaccines, microchipping, and heartworm testing on a walk-in basis at each of its vaccine events. Every pet will receive a free cursory physical exam prior to being vaccinated. This exam is extremely brief and is to make certain that your pet is healthy enough to be vaccinated. Your pet must be bright, alert, responsive, hydrated, eating and drinking normally and have pink gums. For a complete, comprehensive physical exam to discuss any problem your pet is having, please see your full service veterinarian. Because our wellness veterinarian must look at every pet, we cannot vaccinate your pet while it is in your vehicle. If you cannot get your pet in line for the exam, then we cannot vaccinate your pets.All dogs must be on a tight leash. Retractable or loose leashes are not allowed for the safety of your pet and other clients and their pet. All cats must be in a carrier. Cats not in carriers will not be vaccinated.At some of our events, you and your pet may have to wait outside while in line to be seen. Please prepare for cold weather when bringing your pet to TCAP during fall and winter months.
