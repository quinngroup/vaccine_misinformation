The shingles vaccine shot can roughly cut in half your chances of getting shingles, a painful skin rash caused by the same virus that causes chickenpox.If you've already had shingles, the vaccine may help prevent it from coming back.The vaccine contains a weakened chickenpox virus, which doctors call the varicella-zoster virus. It primes your immune system to defend against the disease.Some people who get the vaccine still get shingles. But they're more likely to have shorter periods of shingles-related nerve pain called postherpetic neuralgia, which is very painful and can last weeks, months, or even years after the rash goes away.
