Some parents think their children will not be exposed to diseases like hepatitis B (Hep B)and HPV. Theparents do not understand why Hep Bvaccine is recommended for their infant, who is not participating in sexual activity or intravenous drug use. Other parents dont know why HPV vaccine is needed if their adolescent is not sexually active.The AAP recommends HPV vaccination at 11 to 12 years of age for several reasons: The immune system of an 11- to 12-year-old responds better to the vaccine than that of an older teen. A teen needs all rdoses of the vaccine before ever coming into contact with the virus in order to be fully protected. The uptake for HPV vaccine is lower than other adolescent vaccines given at the same age. Please remember to recommend this as a routine vaccine along with your recommendations for Tdap, Meningococcal, and flu (if during flu season). One way to do this is to say: Today your child is due for 4 vaccines, influenza, HPV, Meningococcal, and Tdap.
