The Pennsylvania Vaccines for Children (PA VFC) program is a federally funded program that provides vaccines at no cost to children who might not otherwise be vaccinated because of inability to pay. CDC purchases vaccines at a discount and distributes thevaccineto grantees - i.e., state health departments and certain local and territorial public health agencies - which in turn distribute thevaccineat no charge to those private physicians' offices and public health clinics enrolled as PA VFC providers. Children who are for VFC vaccines are entitled to receivevaccines recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP).For more information click on the above links or call the Vaccines for Children Programat717-787-5681.
